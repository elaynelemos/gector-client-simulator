It is better for both parties to be honest .
Nevertheless , it will depend on what kind of genetic diseases , given in the context of current medical technology .
I could understand the feeling of the carrier .
Everyone can easily make up the personality and characteristics they want .
However , it is a good practice not to intesively use social media all the time .
It can be very difficult for them but necessary for the carriers and their family .
People can not avoid carrying the disease genes , which they born with .
He can even talk to her daughter face-to-face using video call via internet .
We can not let it go .
Furthermore , since the genetic risk or genetic disease is a very personal case , it is up to the person 's call to tell the relatives about it .
If your genetic results show that you do not have changes associated with an increased risk of heart disease , it is still possible that you develop heart disease .
Moreover , this also provides an alternative way for people to contact a person whom they did not see for a very long time , such as their friends in primary school and secondary school .
One of the reasons why is because as a carrier , she or he needs a mental support to go through with this situation .
Whereas , it can also make people forget to communicate to their family and friends in the real life and affect negatively to their interpersonal skills .
The wolrd is incresingly becoming flat by all kinds of social network website such as facebook and twitter .
It not only affect the interpersonal skills but also bad for people 's health if the ones spend to much time on the social media .
But overall , the advantages far outweigh its disadvantage .
Thus , advice from hospital plays the important role for this .
Intimate interaction greatly lack in social media interactions , particularly the touch .
Awareness of having a genetic disorder may help in diagnosing a genetic disorder for a person , and therefore , this may make the prevention of a certain disorder possible .
Nowadays , the study in the genetic field has gone further and further due to the high-velocity technological advancement .
Aside from hearing the voice , a webcamera could also be affixed to emulate a 'real ' interaction with expressions and gestures .
However for some rare diseases , people who have certain gene changes are guaranteed to develop the disease .
However , they can avoid the disease genes being inhered to their children .
People can promote their friendship and relationship through these social media .
Social media enables us to explore the world far far away without paying expensive airplane tickets and sparing a one-week holiday .
However , there are also some disadvantages occur due to the social media which are concerned in the society .
Regardlessly , if the disorder is rarely to be fatal , or it does not caused any inconvenience to the carrier , revealing the truth is always the right thing to do .
A lot of fresh graduates can find jobs thanks to Facebook and Twitter .
The other advantage is that it is easier to know about others by social media .
For example , in 2012 , there were false rumors of fires , shootouts , and caravans of gunmen in a Mexico City suburb which had spread through Twitter and Facebook .
This phenomenon is caused by rapidly changing technology , which has made communication to be faster than never before .
These are the advantages that save works most of the time .
It is the ethic of staff in hospital to keep the secret of any patients .
There is an element of seeking out for attention rather than expressing one 's true opinion on social networks .
Nowadays , with the advancement of technology , it is easy to do a genetic testing .
By informing them , the carrier is never alone in fighting the battle of such disorder risk .
Nowadays , it is quite common to see on some party , people would more prefer looking at their phones and reading all the posts on facebook if they feel bored .
For example , a grandmother may have more authority to pass on information than an aunt , even when she is not at genetic risk herself while the aunt is .
He may have different considerations other than due to the judging people or may result in making his family worry for nothing when thinking of whether he should tell it to his relatives , and no matter what choice he makes , we need to respect it and we have no right in saying that he must tell his relatives about it .
By telling their relatives that they may have a risk of carrying the disease gene can make their family members bond closely , also many risks and conflicts can be avoided .
In conclusion , a carrier of a known genetic risk should not be obligated to tell his or her relatives .
On the other hand , the viewers , are not the listeners .
With the willing of people to become the best among others , social network site now become a place to show off .
Social media sites are at their peaks at the moment , however , I believe that when people realize that such sites are not making them better persons in real-life , they will not be indulged in it as much as they are now .
The more we care about facebook , the less time we will have to spend with our friends .
On the other hand , when the teenager is studying in a foreign country , the internet is the only way that he can communicate with their parents and friends .
One can not truly show their emotions by another by texting some = ) signs .
Therefore , for an effective and efficient society , there is a need to have a balance of both social media interaction and face-to-face human interaction within its people .
This competitive world is cruel to those are not able to survive .
It could possibly causes a problem in a family due to the fact and creates more unhappiness int the family .
Social media is becoming more important and we need to think more to make it serve us better and better .
With the advancement of technology in recent years , the need to keep in-touch with people and latest news has become a tremendous demand .
However , we are able to chat with our friends without travel to the countries .
Afterward , the carrier will face a serious ethical issue , which is to reveal the problem to his or her relatives or not .
Many people think that the social media sites have benefits on the communication between people while some others argue that there are several negative impacts for the society .
It might not be accurate to judge the other party 's feelings over social media as one may cover up their emotions while on social media .
His relatives can then take measures , if this disease can some how be prevented , to stop this disease from taking their lives .
However , social media solves these problems well .
Life is hard but people can not blame it on being unfair .
They are too busy with their way too many virtual friends and some of them neglect the feelings of their real-life friends .
Think in another way , if we put those time we spend on wandering on those sites , we may already finish one book or do other more meaningful things .
Social media is a trending channel and a suitable mean of communications .
And so , he would have chosen not to undergo generic disorder testing and let the truth be mined forever .
There are possible negative consequences that those might face if they disclose their genetic results to their relative .
Therefore , I thought a known genetic risk should not be obligated to tell his or her family or relatives .
Social media is only beneficial as long as we know how to use it in a correct and suitable way with the combination of both social media sites and daily life interaction to develop people 's potentials to the fullest .
In China , a lot of government organizations have open blogs to communicate with people , like firefighters , police stations and so on .
That shows how actually news and information can be shared easily through social media .
The most popular information get circulated the most so I can seldom miss it .
This essay will discuss about the advantages and disadvantages of using social media in our daily life .
In conclusion , in order to avoid the family-related ethical dilemma , it is best for any carrier of known genetic risk to inform his/her relatives .
Using text-messaging language as an informal way of communicating on social media network also brings in a bad impact for us in a long term .
Thus , the new technology will be able to bring a prosperous future for our and next generation .
This type of communication does not help forging interpersonal relationships .
This will greatly help a society to progress rapidly .
One may think that if the carrier is a caring person who loves his or her family more than himself , there is no doubt that he or she will tell his or her family about the issue .
One advantage is that it is more convenience to contact others by social media .
Last but not least , though genetic testing is a personal matter , telling the result to your family can improve and develop understanding and sympathy of each other as well as promoting awareness of taking care of everyone 's health .
There are advantages and disadvantages in using social media sites , however in this case striking balance between social media and lives is the most important thing to do .
Families are our dearest in our life .
First and foremost , all social media sites are free .
You can share photos , videos and every meaningful experiences of your life .
It will make people spend more time on chatting on the internet rather than communicate face to face such that the interpersonal skill will be badly affected .
Secondly , the carrier of a known genetic risk may destroy the peace of a family even broken the relation between children with the adult .
It is hereditary .
That eliminates the incomplete information disadvantage for some remote rural regions where people are less aware of what actually is happening around them .
However , critics may argue that with the existence of social media sites have reduced physical human interactions among people as they will prefer sitting in front of a computer to going out and meeting new friends .
There are still many disadvantages of using social media .
It makes people worry since if all the teenagers continue using social media frequently , they will decrease the ability to talk to people .
These advantages also comes in handy as most of these social media sites are accessible through mobile application in our smartphones .
Otherwise , making it an obligation will restric the choice of carriers and bring a lot of confusion to their relatives .
I am most inclined to believe that his or her relatives have the rights to know the result .
However wife D is not even under the risk of having this disease .
Furthermore , the annouance of genetic risk would affect the relationship with the relatives as sometimes others may think not to stay too close to the carrier so that they have less chance to get the potential disease .
The spreading of false information can be a potential psychological threat to everyone , given that social media can disseminate information in a realtively fast speed .
We can not blame them that they are liable to the undesired consequences .
However , this is not exactly true when other factors including psychological influence , social influence , are taken into consideration .
Getting connected on social media such as facebook and twitter has become a main trend as well as daily work nowadays .
Although telling James about this is horrible to some extent , he should know what will be likely to be going on for him .
However , in order for people to maintain their relationship as well as making new friends , it requires mutual trust and understanding between both parties .
It will make him or her quite upset when they communicate in real life .
This piece of information does play a role in family planning matters , therefore although no one is obliged to tell about their genetic risk to anyone , it should be encouraged to tell it to their future partner .
Together with the advancement of technology over past decades,medical advancement has increased exponentially and further enhancements are still constantly upgrading.Empower doctors with advance medical knowledge,doctors are able to diagnose and undergo genetic testing for patients to help them prevent and take necessary steps to protect their life.However , once a test has been conducted and the results are known,a question of disclosing the results to his or her relatives become a challenging issue to both patient and doctor.In my opinion,I feel the strong urge to support the obligation to inform patient relatives .
People indeed go to great length to make their words as shorter as they can .
Once his or her family or relatives know that the person does not have the relation with them .
A couple did not have a child after their marriage for a long time , their parents were anxious about that and asked them to go to hospital to check what was the problem .
Facebook and Twitter can serve as an alternative route to make connection between us and our old friends .
This kind of ethical issue can not be judged by the others because they will not understand the position and duty of the carrier in the family .
However , we get less chance and less importance to talk face to face since social media is so convinient , advanced and interesting .
There should not be forced or obligied to do so , as it may negatively and drastically affect the emotions of the genetic risk carrier .
If there is a joke on their facebook page , they may talk to others in this way , " hi , look , how ridiculous this is " , then they laugh together .
Some may even do something wrong .
In conclude , people should think carefully of what is the consequences of telling the relatives his or her generic disorder issue .
This shows that a facebook friend may know more about you than your close friend who does not have a facebook account .
People get connected or closer with same preferences .
They always have a choice about whether to undergo the genetic test or not .
In conclusion , whether or not the carrier wants to tell his relatives regarding his genetic risk , the choice is his because it is his own gene and he has the full right of it .
Firstly , when people rely on the social media to communicate with their friends and parents , they will accustom to communicate by typing and not talking .
People can think while typing and prepare what they want to say but in face-to-face communication , every word that comes out of your mouth and may be not well arranged is the picture of your personality .
People can also know much information about the celebrity in Twitter and Facebook such as Obama , Bill Gates and get the first-hand study materials on it .
With a globalised and interconnected world today , Twitter and Facebook are now the mainstream platform for social interaction .
Social media provides people with the opportunity to get contact with each other every time and everywhere .
To sum up , social media has advantages and disadvantages in people 's daily life .
One should have the full control of his/her information and it is his/her right to decide whether or not to disclose it to some one else .
The children nowadays do not know what is neighbourhood games and who is staying beside them , all they know is pressing icons on the screens .
A research shows that people will unconsciously hide his or her real thought when he or her say or post something that will be exposed to the public .
In a nutshell , every sword has two edges .
After got the divorce certificate , the man showed her the test report ; it wrote that the woman carried the disease gene instead of the man .
On the other hand , there are also problems with the population of the social media .
Nowadays , with the advancement of technology , it is easy to communicate wherever you are .
It is able to detect the illnesses or diseases and even a child 's parentage .
I believe most of us have the experience of suddenly forget how to write a word that we should know .
There are many people in the social media with beautiful image and good content in their pages , however in real life , he or she may do not have jobs or live poorly .
Nonetheless , what seems to make us connected can be the cause that falls us apart .
Everything we type in the social media sites is recorded in the server and then transfer to the companies for spying and advertising .
As many people realize , a genetic disorder can be related to the carrier 's relatives , that is , one of the family members is at risk for a genetic disorder means that other family members also have almost the equally risk to have it , so this problem should be treated seriously by the family .
The certainty of what is being shared or expressed could not be proven physically as media limits this physical interaction , except when using a webcam to chat .
Unlike the use of social media , most of the interaction is done with thinking and typing .
They can build a daily habit to eat less salt and fat and thus to avoid hypertension .
Secondly , social media network opens the door of opportunities for people due to its great benefit in connecting .
People even prefer talk to their friends and meet their friends online and gradually reject face-to-face communication .
Furthermore , with the current technology , smartphones are able to get access to social media sites which have made easier for consumers to use .
However , there are also a great amount of people who against this technology .
In my opinion , the responsibility of telling family and relatives is quite obvious .
In conclusion , social media sites cause both positive and negative consequences for people and society .
With current booming technology , it is agreeable that people become more technology-savvy and they want to spend more time interacting with each others through social media sites , however , it does not mean that we should neglect face-to-face human interaction as it plays even a more important aspect in our life .
In addition , a woman testing positive for BRCA1 would be expected to allow her brother or sister to disclose such information to a niece or nephew rather than do it herself , although this may be further complicated by an individual 's response to risk information as they not want to know .

It means that one can not know another 's real thought and personalities by reading things that he or she put on social network media .
They may know the person 's potential disabled disease or other bad things naturally .
Furthermore , not everyone on the social media sites is honest .
Many people says they will support the social media since it really helps them to have a closer view about how their friends are going in other parts of the world .
Several arguments have been made regarding the social media actually have some inevitable disadvantages to people .
Privicy protection belongs to one 's human rights .
Due to the popularity of social media , many people start to do their business via these sites .
The son was died after one year 's treatment and the couple got divorced later after that .
Whether we are at home or at school , at work or on a holiday , we are able to communicate and interact with our friends .
This is reasonable since the exposure of the truth of being a carrier may make them be discriminated or sympothized by others which is not positive factors brought to their life .
What 's more , various of cultures can be shown to us through social medias .
No matter it is a party , dinner or just simply get-together , there always are some people bow their head and playing their phones even their family and friends are in front of them .
Thus , the lack of face-to-face human contact through social media restricts actual interaction which can be stimulated through the media .
Many people are very brave in telling people about their opinions online but in real life some of them can be very shy and not outspoken at all .
That plays an important role in the possibility that relatives can overcome the discrimination of the society and anxiety about the risks .
With the help of social media , I become real life friends with those from online forums whom I share the same interest with .
It saves a lot of money and time as well as strengthen our relationship although we stay at different places around the world .
However , since internet were known , telephone started to give way to social media sites .
This also means that as soon a person is made aware of his or her genetic profile , he or she concurently has a knowledge about others .
In my opinion , social media websides such as Twitter and Facebook will not affect the chance for people to have face to face contact and thus negatively affects interpersonal skills .
In addition , it is impractical to make such a law .
As people spend more and more time on such social media sites , the importance of the face-to-face human contacts has decresed .
In addition , with all those " nice " guys around on the social network website , one may neglect people surrounding him or her but just communicate with friends on facebook .
As a result , people think of theirselves lowly and may lead to depression and mental disorder .
You can see people playing Facebook , Twitter through their smart phones or ipad on buses or on trains .
This is their human right to know about that , and this may also save their lives by preventing the disorder to happen .

She or he does not want to be the source of unhappiness in thefamily .
Above all , social network site is like a two sided knife and people can only take good advantage of it by avoiding the possible disadvantages of it such as put less personal information on his or her facebook page .
And at the same time , improves the interpersonal skill , through dynamic practises betwwen individuals and realtime presence .
This means that the students are not concetrating when they supposed to do so .
These social media may be tools of their campaign and manipulating the thoughts of the public .

It is only after we tell them will they start paying attention to their health .
Intensive use of Social media does reduce the time people spend in face-to-face communication .
Nothing is absolute right or wrong .
People who aware of having such disorder can prevent the disorder to happen by adapting a healthy lifestyle , including having a balanced diet and at least having exercise for 30 minutes every day .
Sometimes some family structure and cultural beliefs can influence the pattern of communication .
For example , breast cancer is a genetic disease and it can be cured if it is being realised in the early stage .
Although there might be a lot of challenges along the way in seeking medical attention , such as financial issue , everyone should be given the rights of knowing their family 's inherented medical conditions .

People should enjoy the advantages of social media while be aware of the disadvantages of that and try their best to avoid the disadvantages happen to them and their friends and family .
It may affect our daily lives and we will think about it every day .

Thus , we are going to identify the advantages and disadvantages of the issue which is " should or should not " .

The issue on right to know or not to know is highly debatable although it is a genetic risk , one can not be entire sure because the genetic information could possibly result from the families of either parents - his maternal and paternal uncles , aunts or cousin .
This improves the connectivity between the users .
These social media serves a purpose to bind people in spite of their geographical boundaries but it does n't mean that surrounding people are neglected as the payoff .
Other people should not be told without the person 's permission even though they are his or her family or relatives .

Genetic testing is a personal choice .
Though because of this , social media is still a much fairer and more transparent online platform for the public to share ideas compared to other traditional medias .
If your genetic results indicate that you have gene changes associated with an increased risk of heart disease , it does not mean that you definitely will develop heart disease .
This subsequently leads to the poor interpersonal skills that inhibit the growth of our real social circle .
However , it will become a controversial issue as it becomes a dilemma for a carrier of a known genetic risk to inform his or her relatives .
On the other hand , social media also has disadvantages which have created worries to the society recently and made it a controversial phenomenon .

Thank to those social media , the communication among people all over the world is possible and can be done with ease .
However , thanks to facebook , I can still keep in touch with them and I know what they are doing recently as we living close to each other .
Furthermore , since many teenagers and young adults are fans of social media , these information can reach them easily without them need to watch or listen to the news reports .
Thus , much thought need to put on the immediate family as it could caused a stir of unwanted events from the patient or the family members itself .
First and foremost , I would like to share on the advantages of using such social media in my daily life .
It can make people become closer as well .
This essay will illustrate the pros and cons of using social media in modern society .
Therefore , I think a known genetic risk should not be obligated to tell his or her family or relatives without the person 's permission .

So all the married couples go run a test and know they are not carriers.They might subconsiously see him as different and worry that he will find a wife who will carry this gene as well .
Ultimately , the best way to enhance interpersonal skills is still through face-to-face meetings but social media sites are only the tools to enhance it .
Using a common social media site with my friends to help me know what are their statuses nowadays .
This covenience can be percieved as almost in realtime .
And both are not what we want since most of us just want to live as normal people .
We become so anxious that we can not focus on everything .
Social media provides people a way of talking and chatting which can never be considered as a way of communication .
As more and more social websites such as Twitter , Facebook and Weibo which have become ubiquitous , seamless and imperative in our life , people may worry about the young generation having problems in face-to-face communication skills .
However , when people become more and more addicted to this convenience and fail to communicate with people who are close to them , their face-to-face interpersonal skills are lost .
When ones chat on those media sites , there is no eye connection , no emotion delivery and even the expressions are typed in by using some combinations of punctuations .
The appearance of those social media sites causes those problems to be solved .
As people feel more confident online where they do not have to face in real-life on the spot , they feel more comfortable and thus prefer communicating online .
This results in lack of interpersonal skills in individual , especially young students as they always have option to turn their back to the real-life and go online .
We can not deny that the social media sites truly make the old friends do not lose the information and the chances to communicate with you even you are in a different country .
To put it in the nutshell , everything has its own pros and cons .
If used for a good purpose , it can prevent unnecessary unhappiness , however , it could also make situation worse by revealing who the carrier is , in the family .
Everything will be bad if we do n't know how to use them wisely no matter whether it is really good or not .
Therefore , I would agree to that it 's obligated for a carrier of known genetic risk to tell his or her relatives to avoid any family-related ethical dilemma that could be raise up in the future .
I do think there is difference in it and I believe many of us will agree .
Social media has been playing a vital important role in our lives today .
To the whole society , it is a duty .
Families give you the courage and support which you can not retrieve by yourself .
Moreover , the truth can not be hidden forever but when it is revealed , more shocking and upset it will be .
It is quite significant especially for those young teenagers since they would rather go to these sites to see the news and know what happened in this world than read the newspaper every day .
Interpersonal skills , like any other skills requires practice .
Thanks to them , people can get to know one another online , without having to travel to meet up for business purposes for companies or personal reasons .
This essay will discuss about whether a carrier of a known genetic risk should tell his or her relatives or not .
A known genetic risk can also affect our next generation critically .
When people get use of using socia media to contact other people , what will happen is that their interpersonal communicating skills will degrade and lost eventually .
The answer is simply that everyone , especially our family , has the right to know the truth .
Not only the child but also the entirely family will suffer .
Almost all students and young adults possess the Facebook or Twitter account .
On the other hand , social media sites also bring some negative impacts for the people and the society .
This essay will discuss the reasons why the relatives are obligated to be informed that their children have genetic risk .
More people ( relatives ) know her problem , more information channel is provided .
A guy who is going travel for months can easily tell all of his friends about his activity .
We think we are all connected through all sorts of social media , but do we really get connected or falling apart ?
Secondly , people 's over-addition may avoidably , to some degree , exacerbate social alienation , and this kind of alienation causes some social media users to suffer from the over-dependence of virtual social networking .
With the risk of being genetically disorder , many individuals have done the decision to undergo genetic testing .
With the improvements of technology , a new life with genetic risk can be detected .
People can only use electical devices to access internet .
To prevent the bigger problem to happen , it takes a lot of effort to take care of your body .
It seems that people build a good relationship with others by the social media , but the problems come out .
Parents and relatives have to work longer than expected and endlessly to foster their child if he/she is not able to foster himself/herself .
All users ' needs are an internet connection and an email account so that everyone can have a Facebook or Twitter ID to start their journey in social media life .
Social media sites suppose be a very useful and convenient tool to use and bring people get closer in this globalised world .
In conclusion , everything has two sides of stories .
Secondly , annouance the potential risk would cause the family member to be scared of this certain issue , although the factor would not be that serious , people would still fear that they would have some potential disease in the future thus go to hospital and do additional check or take more medicine in order to prevent the disease , and this creats unnecessary costs to the family .
In the chat room , she created a close relationship with eight people .
This is the common law in the society .
With more convinient and humanian communications , the relationship between government and people get largely improved .
In the end , I believe that the support in terms of mental or even monetary from your family could help the carrier to fight against the genetic disease .
On the contrary , social media makes people lose their ability to communicate effectively in their real lives and makes people risk exposing their privacy to those whose identity can not be verified on the social media sites .
In conclusion , it will be considerate to inform the risk of getting the same genetic disease to the relatives .
This will lead to a bad inter-personal skill as well as a problem of trusts .
In the past decades , when the social media sites are not yet fully developed , people connect with others who live far away by using a phone , or even a letter .
The seriousness can be larger than our imagination .
It is a method that benefits two parties which is a win-win situation .
If he chooses to live in the uncertainty that the gene holds and willing to accept it , he could do that , and it has been something that is 'normal ' to everyone in the past as gentic testing was not possible .
In this particular case , we are discussing about whether a person should tell his relatives about him having a RISK of a particular genetic disease .
One of the disadvantage that many people concerns is that people loss the interest of face-to-face communication .
They need to ask for doctor 's advice before they plan to have a baby .
But there is possibility that the person on the other side is deceiving you in order to obtain your information against you .
Without their concern and support , we are hard to stay until this time .
Finding old friends through Facebook , for example , is more easier than asking people around in real life .
Once one person in the family is found to be carrying risky genetic , other members in his or her family may also have the risk of disease .
With the help of social media tools , we can stay in contact and keep ourselves up to date with our family and friends even though we are away from them .
For an example , one is able to send notifications and other information we use to have them in hardcopy previously , over the web and the process takes seconds .
As a result , they will lose eyes to contact and hands to express their feeling to people nearby them , which means they have lost the tools they need for face-to-face contact communicating .
For those who lives within the community should at least meet up , and not use social media as the primary source of communcation with each other .
Thus , this makes Twitter and Facebook become one of the medium that we need .
Once people 's genetic information is told to other people .
Without facebook , we may lost contact .
Social media enables people from different parts of the world to communicate with one another .
Since the technology of modern society has been so advanced , it becomes possible for people to make decision to take genetic test so as to be clear whether or not they carry genetic risk which can affect their next generation .
If a law requires someone to tell others ' his or her privacy especially when the one is not willing to do so .
Furthermore , living with a secret is not a good sensation , especially if the situations of other relatives become worse , you should feel guilty and depressed .
There are three reasons as follows .
Nevertheless , they still can use phone to do normal call and message to contact .
I agree that a carrier of a known genetic risk is obligated to tell his or her relatives .
All-in-all , it depends on individual and also the nature of the disease , but he or she should be obligated to inform the relatives if there are possibilities in curing or preventing it .
Moreover , people can be aware of what is going on in social situation and see the comments online and share their opinions on these websites .
People usually get this kind of hypertesion after they become adult .
So we need to make best use of these social media and make it a fun way of adding some excitement when life is boring .
Nowadays , social media are able to disseminate information faster than any other media .
Years ago when these modern products have not been popular , the way for people to communicate or contact people far way are still restricted in making phone calls , sending emails or writing letters .
People can contact their friends on the internet and get their reply very fast .
This essay will illustrate in two aspects .
In the past , we travel by ship and now we can use airplane to do so .
Firstly , the social media sites can connect people with their friends and parents closely .
Especially for the young people without marrige , if he/she is known to have some genetic risk , it may have certain chance that his/her child would carry the same disease , but not in certain .
Because if you are carrying that genetic risk , then there is great possibility that your relatives like parents or siblings are carrying the same genetic risk as well .
Updated news people care about can be easily obtained when you refresh your social media sites on your smart phones and laptops almost every time at any time .
To sum up , a carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to tell his or her relatives .
If there is no social media , it is difficult for people to know about a stranger .
This is because many relate genetic diseases to those such as Bubble-Boy disease , autism or down-syndrome .
The cyber communication is quite different to face to face communication and people who depends on cyber communication too much will not get used to the real life communication .
Nevertheless , with those advantages , some disadvantages may appear such as reduction in face-to-face human contact which affects interpersonal skills , privacy issue , as well as some frauds that can be done through social media .
However , social media site is a double-sided sword , it also bring in some negative effect on our daily life .
What is the basic difference between genetic disorder and other disorders .
In the view of my point , a carrier of a known genetic risk should not be obligated to tell his or her relatives , with the support of the following reasons .
People can also get to know their friends ' state and mood by looking at their posts on line .
Everything comes with benefits will also have their disadvantages .
The use of social media has largely influenced our ways in communicating with one another .
Introverts or those who are shy to communicate with their friends are now able to do so in the form of words via social media platform .
Therefore , this kind of circumstances will not be happened again and again .
It is true that social media makes people be able to connect one another more conveniently .
However , there are risks of false information and chances of miscommunication .
Genetic testing has been made possible- it has become easy to tell if one is a carrier of a known genetic risk through genetic testing .
Furthermore , some will wish not to become a burden of anyone as seeking medical attention is relatively costly .
However , there is a role and a sense of responsibility to inform their relatives since it is a genetic disorder .
Then wife D might tell her mother , who likes to gossip on her way to the theatre .
Although it helps to connect us with our friends wherever we are , it at the same time reduces the chance for us to talk to our friends face to face which may affect our interpersonal skills .
If phone and letter are the only way to contact them , we would probably not able to find them .
Genetic disorders are innate , but the great improvement of medical treatment makes it possible for humans to prevent the disorder or to reduce the negative effects of the disorder on themselves .
In increasingly globalised world , such platforms even enhances and compliccates the links between indivduals in the world .
On the other side , as stated above , a person who want to confirm and has been prepared to face the result can choose to do the genetic testing individually .
For Facebook , a comprehensive way of sharing is offered since multiple photos and videos can be uploaded , long notes can be published , even documents and data can be shared through Facebook nowadays .
He runs a test and know that he has the gene AA .
In my opinion , the carrier of a known genetic risk has to tell his or her relatives about this .
Family members , as one the closest group of people from whom they can get comfort , is a crucial factor for them to successfully get over any possible troubles as a result of genetic disorder .
This becomes a huge problem when they have no choice but have to face things in real life .
On the other hand , if the genetic risk is kept as a secret , although it may benefit the carrier to a certain extend and help to keep the privacy , but it has much larger negative impacts to the family members and relatives .
To some extent , this makes our life more luxry and blundering .
However , hospital can provide a councilor to advice the carrier about the action can be taken .
I also discover some of my friends ' interest which I find common with myself so that talking to one another is much more about life , study , friends , etc .
Some people spend a lot of time in it and forget their real life .
Also , telling them the result can let them largely reduce the cost for multiple testing .
Genetic testing is made possible and available for one 's decision to undergo .
However , the problem is , will the people really enjoy their life if they have to stay at hospital everyday and with all the needles and endless pain ?
I met some canadian friends in Egypt .
Furthermore the act of informing others without the consent from their parents or the patients itself could harm the psychological state of the affected family .
Think of the other way , if a child of the family knows that he has the risk to become a genetic risk carrier , and the risk might as well inherit to his child in the future , his whole life will be in a dilenma .
This saves a lot of time for me in reading newspapers and watching TV .
Thirdly , a lot of updating of luxury living standard as well as other show-off situations may make people 's daily life more and more grandiloquent , which is not an accurate social growing trend .
This is the responsibility of being a parent .
With just a touch away from any meida/electronic devices , one can easily interact and communicate with his friends without much hassle .
More and more young people tend to live in social media world most of their time and reduce face-to-face human contact , which can affect interpersonal skills and relationships in social life .
There are four reasons why people do n't have to be shy and share their problems regarding genetic disorder .
They play the important role in our life which can not be substituted .
In China , the older generation with traditional culture background , will always think of having more children as well as grandchildren , to make the family liven up and stronger .
Unlike just keeping contact numbers that we may not even call , social media like facebook is a great way for friends from different field or even from different parts of the world to be connected .
Once we found we were carrying this genetic risk , it is better for us to tell our family members because they may carry it as well .
However , as I said earlier , it is better for the person to at least tell about the potential risk to his or her future partner since his genetic risk may affect his children later .
There are a lot of disadvantages that people may not realize of .
So I think whatever the genetic is or whether the gene is match with their parents , it should not be told to anyone even his or her family or relatives .
It is a long time discussion that whether a carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to tell his or her relatives that his or her disease is caused by gene .
Recent research has shown that the more people spend time on social media sites , the less they become ambitious .
They are just scrolling down pages of pages of pictures and statuses and see one of them which they might think it funny .
Therefore , with the help of technology , people are able to catch up wth each other conveniently .
But seriously , most people only post the happiest moments in their lives .
It might not be able to replace the joy that you have when you are with your family but it could help to reduce the sadness of being away from your family .
They can learn how these people succeed and they can also have the chance to talk with them and know these famous persons ' thought by using the social media .
Or else , if he holds back the genetic risk , they may have a unhealthy baby and may cause the death of the baby or end of their marriage .
The receipent,will then receive the information almost immediately depending on the quality of the network .
By telling to his or her family other than being a support , they could possibly help her to get alternative solutions to the problem that she is facing right now .
In addition , privacy issue has become more popular nowadays since some people do not realize that they may actually share some information that they are not willing to share at the first place .
For example , in 2012 general election is Singapore , Dr Tan Chee Keong made use of facebook to spread his campaign videos to the public .
When people want to check whether they are genetic risk carriers , they can go and approach a doctor to consult about it .
And it becomes more convenient to obtain and update information by using social media .
Secondly , genetic disease has a close relationship with the born gene together with their daily habits .
Advantages and disadvantages of using social media in daily life
Thirdly , some diseases are not noticeable and may lead to serious health problems .
When their children become teenagers , a lot of social problems may arise .
One of the reasons that the parents should be informed is that they have to decide whether they are capable to raise a child with genetic risk .
Communication would have took a different turn without the easily available social media .
Compared to face-to-face interaction , online conversation is easier for strangers to open their mouth to each other .
If the genetic risk carrier is a minor or a child , then most likely the decision of informing the relative should be made with the consideration of the patients parents or legal guardian .
Having support from relatives are vital as they ensure the genetic risk carrier that he/she is not alone in facing this illness and it will certainly provide a morale boost as the whole family will share a common sentiment with regards towards the future prospect of the genetic disorder which could be inherited by anyone in the family .
Some of the famous examples would be social media sites like Twitter and Facebook .
Writing is an essential skill of person who express their own feelings and opinions .
People can know their friends ' recently looks and interesting things happens on that people just by checking their facebook or other social media sites .
Hence it lessens valuable interaction between human and time we spend away from the computer screen or mobile phone .
Then , we need to talk about the advantages and disadvantages of using social media in your daily life and society .
In real life , establishing friendship requires the all-rounded understanding in one another and the caring for one another .
This obeys their own willingness as in they have to accept the truth which may make their following life miserable .
The question is whether a carrier of a known genetic risk should tell his or her relatives .
For example , within a family , regardless of who had first received genetic information , parents were seen as having the primary responsibility to pass on information to any offspring , either adult at risk .
Instead , we will post a seed and tag our friends to inform this kind of changments .
Not only the phone did the jobs for them , but also devices like personal computer , laptop , tablet , and many other devices which are able to connect to internet .
It also reduces our sympathy .
For a carrier of genetic disorder to know the fact that he or she is a carrier , it causes more dilemma rather than getting the disorder .
Undeniable , it becomes more addicting when we spend more time busy socialising and interacting virtually .
They should let their spouse know about his or her situation before marriage .
It is immoral and impractical .
Nowadays , with the development of technology and society , social media become more popular and even important in our daily life .
Distance and time are no longer the problems , which is convenient especially when instant chat is needed .
A good law should be clear and easy to execute .
Social media sites like Twitter and Facebook are popular among people in order for them to connect to others even from different countries .
Though it is said that genetic testing involves emotional and social risks due to the test results , while the potential negative impacts of the risk still exist , the consequence will be significant if other members of his or her family do not know .
It will be hard for an individual to deal with the issue on its own .
However , there exits some disadvantages which will affect people in some degree .
As it is a genetic risk,the patient next-of-skin might have a high chance of carrying the risk,hence the need to inform their relatives is important so that necessary prevention actions could be taken before unforeseen circumstances might occur.For example,if you are the only child in a family and unfortunately,you are suffering from a genetic disease that the genetic trait might be passed on to your next generation if you have a child,hence by letting your family members aware of the situation,it would lessen family stresses and suffering on forcing you to settle down and have children.However , social ethic issues like discrimination and privacy are biggest concerns and potential barriers to enforce patients or doctors to disclose information to patients relatives.It challenges the confidentiality and privacy principles.Currently , under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 ( HIPAA ) in the United States,there is no legal obligation requirement to disclose information to relatives,it is up to the patient 's wish to disclose to their family members.Early disclosement to family members brings in positive reaction and prevention,as in the case of Angelina Jolie,she chose to disclose information and underwent treatment to reduce the risk of breast cancer significantly to under five percent.I still can recall her reason for disclosing her own story was that she does not want to live under the shadow of cancer .
How can they not tell their loved ones who they really are and get their loved ones in danger ?
It is almost imposible for us to keep way from it .
If they spend too much time on these social media , it may cause some problems to their mental development .
This kind of feeling makes people 's relationship not as stable , secure and reliable than before .
With the aids of social media , people bonds globally , information flows rapidly , and human lives happily .
The inclusion of intimate presence and relative touch could also bring a better rapport between those interacting .
Large numbers of patients with the genetic risk would want to keep it as a secret as the genetic risk may indicates their high chance to carry certain disease .
Then nobody wants to marry A , or his relatives .
These social media makes people 's life much more colorful and provide a lot of fun .
It is a hard decision to make but with the most appropriate way , it will create great circumstances for the carrier and families in the future .
People should avoid the misuse of socia media and use it in the proper way .
They were told that the wife 's family was carrying the polygenetic disorder and can pass only to boys rather than girls .
From some points of view , social really has a lot of advantages by let us communicate with friends cheaper and more conveniently .
The profile picture may not be the person who that user says he or she really is .
First of all , people saves money by using internet to contact other people and reading news .
People do not have the ability to choose their gene , they should not be thought badly because of bad gene .
This should be accepted from the point of human right , freedom of acceptance of relatives as well as many other social reasons .
Secondly , it can avoid genetic disease passed to the next generation when they intend to have babies .
And even we gather together more people find themselves has less topics to talk than before and choose to digging from their social media again .
However , it is also bringing some social changes whereby such virtual worlds are overtaking the real-life world , resulting in some negative impacts in individuaul 's daily lives and therefore becoming a large problem in societies as a whole .
The government should set the law to protect this kind of privacy .
This might be beneficial for his future if he is aware of the risk of having this disorder .
She talked with them every night , trust them and share her life with them .
As a result , they will gradually decrease in their ability to compete with each other in the society .
In cases where an individual has gotten to know of a genetic disorder , disclosing or otherwise , to his or her relative is solely a matter of preference within the indivdial moral system .
A person with a disorder , regardless of mental or physical disorder , is always easy to be awared by his or her families .
People and friends often mock of your conditions .
In this case , I have to say that to err is human .
The reason why it is so addictive is , that the more people get into the social media , they seek attention from their friends .
However,there are still people against the decision of revealing private information.As in the case of Alzheimer patients,it is up to the patient 's own choice to disclose information.However,research has shown that doctors have tried to interpret who,how and whom will Alzheimer disease be disclosed to minimise potential negative impact to families members ( DementiaToday,2012 ) .There are associations provide helps to Alzheimer patients like Alzheimer 's Association ( Alzheimer 's Association,1980 ) .Although there are still thousand of genetic risk diseases out there that might not be receiving all helps and supports from everyone,the needs to receive immediate understanding and support from family members is an utmost help that patients need in their difficult time .
We should take the advantages of the creatures we create and try to avoid the negative effects .
As a result , the family generation stops by the moment the adult carrier announces his issue .
First of all , it can be an alert for the family members of the patient and let them be aware of the possible disease that they may also have .
Nevertheless , the advantages of social media will benefit the masses if the negative aspects of it can be carefully taken care of .
Secondly , without the truly communication in the real life , people lose the ability to see the truth and false .
We can know more news and cultures through socia medias .
The medical treatment technology during that time is not advanced enough to completely cure him .
It is therefore I would agree for the obligation of telling the relatives of both parties when one is about to get married and have a plan for giving birth .
Thus , you can see that some students will browse facebook while attending lectures .
It is just because that you do not become strong enough to overcome the hard time .
The users , soon , will realise that they do not need such social media sites to keep in contact with the their friends because , if they really need somebody , they will reach the friends no matter what .
However , every year the government has to spend a lot to help the disables such as medical subsidizes and builds up special schools to educate them .
Instead , all of them were more interested in posting pictures of this " cheerful " meeting on their social media sites .
Some will take long time and some are not efficient enough for people to get their response .
They will consider whether to give a birth to a new baby because of this genetic problem and they will start finding ways to try to avoid their baby to carry this genetic risk as well .
The relationship between the parents and their children should not be tested only in the genetic way ; it is something much deeper and tighter .
Actually , I have seen some people are very funny and interesting when I am chatting with them online .
In less than a week half of the town knows person A has a risked gene , and his family might be a genetically risked family .
In real life , we communicate with one another as equal participants .
Therefore , people may not contact with the faraway friends and relatives unless there are something important .
To prevent that from happening , I do feel that it is up to the person whether he wants to share the information with his family since his family may either be paranoid or judge him and act differently .
For an example , if we change our contact numbers , we will not send SMto each of individual any longer .
Through the social media sites , we can chat with our friends who stay in Europe and New Zealand .
Those who are born into a family with a history of genetic disease should be allowed to undergo genetic testing , even though if there is no risk at all .
The last but not the least , with all kinds of personal information on one 's social network page , it is covenient for criminal to make use of this information to commit a crime .
They have the right to know whether they are at risk .
A study of New York University in 2010 shown that patients with family members around generally recovers 2-4 days faster than those taken care by professional nurses .
It is normal for people to demand for a fair and similar treatment as the others and therefore it is normal for people to try to keep some of their secrets or personal issues to themselves in case some people judge them or treat them differently.Many people really love to hear what they want to hear and therefore they may just ignore the word 'risk ' and assume that the person has suffered from the disease .
It has erased the boundaries of distance and time .
In conclusion , I think social media has reshaped interpersonal relationships from a more human-based friendship that requires sharing and caring between friends , to a more information-based friendship that requires a mutual interest .
Therefore I believe the parents have their right to know the healthiness of their child .
Some may share fewer and fewer time with their family and not knowing how to express themselves .
First , social media networks have a lot user base , it helps to link people from different parts of the world .
And try to bypass the shortcomings .
If the parents know that one of them is a carrier and disclose the information to their relatives then they can bring their children to undergo genetic testing and do n't need to be shy of it because it is for the sake of their children 's health .
However , critics may argue that not all information or news disseminated are reliable .
The images we choose to present are tentatively considered .
This is a serious social problem and affects a lot of people .
However , if you tell the truth to your wife and relatives , you offer a chance about whether to have child or not .
Hence , for a family in which every member is truly believing in each other and loving each other ,all these troubles are just testaments to make them stronger .
Social network plays a role in providing and also filtering information .
On the other hand , it may even increase the chance of having face to face contacts amoung people .
Imagine you are living like a normal person but suddenly one day your relative comes tells you that actually there are some possibilities that you may encounter some disease in the future , what kind of feeling are you going to have ?
In addition , there are also chances for people to miscommunicate with each other as they can not sense the tone of the other party over social media platforms .
Therefore , it would be better for the carrier to be obligated to tell the information to the relatives , in order to let them know and prevent the potential disease through daily exercises .
If the carrier refuses to tell the truth to his or her spouse , another life may have risk of inheriting the genetic disease .
Other people then are influenced by us and tend to do the same .
Although not everyone is good at public relationship even without the existence of the social media sites , we can not deny that it do affect some people in their ability of interpersonal skills .
As we graduate from a school , we will probably lose contact with some of our friends .
There might be a possibility that the genetic disorder could also affect their relatives and any other families within the same family tree .
However , if they already know they have a gene that may make them have higher possibilities to get hypertention .
Many people feel that we should tell our relatives since we really care about their health status .
It is up to people 's discretion and comprehension to decide which side they want to take .
Some of the diseases may not show symptoms until the carrier is old enough .
It will be really sweet and you two will surelly become closer .
Substantial cost is saved without the tiring travel from one point to another point .
The sharing of information can be done faster through social media as well , that is why nowadays many news publishers make their own social media account , for example Channel News Asia has a twitter account and will update its follower with headline news .
Another problem with social media is that , the benefits from investing such enormous time and energy is not relfected as something positive to the users .
The children rely the parent to live .
If they do not even know that they are at risk for a genetic disorder , how can this explain their right ?
If the carrier does n't tell his or her relatives , it may be too late to get their support and prepare financially .
Personally I am study in oversea , busy study life keeps me away from contact my old friend .
Twitter , Facebook and Skype are some social media sites which enable us to keep in touch with our friends or family who are in other cities or countries .
On the other hand , if there are ways can help us to control or cure the disease , we can going through thses process from the scope of the whole family .
Some say that it is a necessary step for human revolution .
Any individual at risk for a disorder has the right to undergo genetic testing , but whether the results should be informed to others , especially close family or relatives , is the topic that worth discussing .
It is still early for parents to decide whether they can foster a new life that are not able to work and may suffer the pain in the entire life .
If one such relative is told that he or she may have higher risk of getting sick , he or she may have be scared about the unknown life , partners , spouse and colleagues may choose to leave , and many other situations may happen which means the relative 's life may be ruined .
If he or her not get married , he or she must tell his or her partner that he carries disease gene .
These malicious comments often go viral and it creates a strong negative effect on the real user in real life , which might lead to unwilling attitude to interact with others in real life by the victim .
The auto correction software is so effective when using electronic device until we did not realize the importance of writing .
The basis of a family is that everyone trusts and love each other with no doubts .
However , in my opinion , it is the obligation of a carrier of a known genetic risk to tell his or her relatives about his or her actual situation .
Furthermore , as it is a genetic problem , it will be better for the carrier to inform his or her family as other family member might experience the same thing .
Secondly , social network may leak certain personal informations to the public , as the cyber environment is not perfect and not safe , people may not protect their privacy online effectively and sometimes , some people may use others personal information to deceive .
For example , on mother 's day , people are shy to say " I love you " to their mothers so they can type it on his or her mother 's facebook page .
With my social network account , I seldom read newspapers or go to news websites anymore ; because I can easily read them from the status of my friends .
They may set a bias on this person even abandon his or her .
Afterall , what affects one family may or may not affect another although the families has a common genetic make up , shared by either of the parents .
We can not deny that the genetic testing really helps people a lot when they face the disorder problem .
I started invoving into Facebook one years ago,when I just arrived singapore .
More and more illness are discovered to be related to some genes with the development of the medical technology .
The more time we spend on these sites , the lesser time we spend on face-to-face interacting with one another .
Spouses usually have very close relationships , if person A tell his family that he has this gene , his uncle C knows and tells his wife D that he needed to run a test because his cousine has this disease .
Some genetic gene will pass only to boys rather than girls , some are on the contrary .
One might also choose to hint or encourage their certain relatives to run a gene test if they are concerned about negative consequences that comes across when they disclose their genetic results .
After came back from the hospital , the man told his parents that the problem was that he carried a disease gene so that they can not have a baby in their life time .
For example , if a carrier is told that he/she has the risk to have diabetes .
Information got circulated .
Nobody can deny social media 's advantages as the benefit it provides in connecting people regardless of nationalities , races , cultures and languages .
In Singapore , many Malaysian cross the sea to work here .
Furthermore this also possibly triggers the privacy issues as the Facebook allows some other profit-driven companies to have access to the information on the users .
The reason might just be that he or she just wants to " decorate " his or her face .
In my opinion , the patients , which are carriers of some known genetic risk are supposed to share the truth with their family members .
While social media brings convenience to people life , people are more and more willing to use social media for chatting instead of face-to-face chatting which has a time and place requirement .
People with close blood relationship generally carry some similar genes .
Social media sites are also a very useful tool for people to start a new friendship or relationship .
And people on the other side will only need a second to receive the message .
Though social media do create relationships , relationships and friendships are only firm and real if people have gone through experiences and communication in face-to-face interaction .
In conclude , socia media benefits people in several ways but in the same time harms people .
Although some people feel that an individual who is found to carry a dominant gene for Huntington 's disease has an ethical obligation to disclose that fact to his or her siblings , there currently is no legal requirement to do so .
That is the most essential elements to overcome the challenges .
With no close relationship in real life but only close cyber friends , one is more possibly to feel lonely because the physiological need of human beings is to feel the bond with others by our five senses .
On one hand , we do not want this potential danger causing firghtenning affects in our families ' later lives .
However , it leads to a new problem that " should a carrier of a known genetic risk be obligated to tell his or her relatives ?
Therefore their son was inherited the genetic disease .
Nevertheless,everything in life has positive and negative effects .
Therefore , once people find they have carried the disease genes , they should be responsible to tell their relatives , at least their family members .
In my opinion , every individual has to take responsibility of their own lives by making a right decision .
Therefore , social networks brings more and more connections between people and they may have a chance to chat with people they never known before , and this helps to develop the interpersonal skills as well .
For instance , John is informed by his doctor that he is at risk for a genetic disorder but he does not tell his sibling , James about this .
How much a genetic change tells us about your chance of developing a disorder is not always clear .
This means one of his parents has gene A and one cost of testing could be saved .
As the development of the technology , social media becomes more and more significant role in the whole world .
How can a law made by government exempt such a group of people from preparing to face their potetial disease ?
That is why facial impression is one of the most important elements in social learning .
Personally I feel that we still should take our responsibility to tell them the situation .
They may do not want this truth to influence their life or want to keep it as a secret and do not others know about it .
Nowadays , people not only pursuit the comfort of their own life but also a better development of their following generations .
In my opinion , although the annouance of carrying a genetic risk involves the issue of self privacy , it is necessary for the carrier to be obligated to tell the issue to his or her relatives in order for them to prevent the potential disease .
Nevertheless , there are cyber polices who roam around these social networking platforms to prevent these hoaxes spreading around .
Their son unfortunately fell ill and he was diagnosis a kind of genetic disease which is very serious .
Even though you can not eliminate the risk completely , you can at least try to be alert to avoiding getting the disease .
Gone were the times , and now we do mass sending and the receiver may feel less meaning in such online wishes .
As the techonology has been advancing , it has reached a stage whereby the advancement triggers some ethical dilemmas in relation to the acutual use of the techonology .
Photos and informations retrieved from their profile page may be fabricated to suit certain personal agenda .
Therefore , telling the families and the relatives to get prepared for fighting the disease and even prevent to get the disease is your responsibility .
More importantly , it is cheap and easy to use social media .
It started withthe invention of technology which has evolved tremendously over the past few decades .
Generally , the clinic or hospital will not tell the carrier 's families without the agreement of carrier .
May be we can trust our immediate family members but can we really trust all the other relatives ?
During that period , if one of the family member reflects genetic disorder symptoms , he will fell in an ethical dilenma for sure .
Genetic disorder may or may not be hirataged hereditary disease and it is sometimes hard to find out one has these kinds of diseases .
Nowadays , the advancement of technologies improves the life of many people a lot .
Besides that , these skills requires time to develop and adapted .
Being the parent , you are not responsible to you next generations , since you allow the genetic risk to be passed on by generation and generation and being aware of it .
Nowadays , even some companies conduct online video interview with their applicants as it saves time and cost .
The broadcasting and viewing model is not good for forging relationships .
In conclusion , although the unsafe online environment , spend too much time on internet may be the potential negative factors of using online social networks .
Seconly , the relatives of the carrier can also choose to do genetic testing regardless of the dignosis of the carrier .
The parents give knowledge and love to the children , meanwhile they feel happy with the accompany of the children .
Last but not least , social media sites also link people together through allowing us to create our own groups , pages or sites to share our hobbies , interests and studies in particular subjects .
If a person is obliged to tell his/her relatives , he or she might be discriminated by those who do not carry this gene .
Some may say that the appearance for these modern media will reduce the chance for people to communicate face to face .
All-in-all , social media is the product of rapid technological advancement and there are more to come in future .
We tend to post pictures with the best looks , status that are funny .
Indeed , I myself use Facebook just because of the friends ' contacts that I want to keep .
First , for the case of marrige , people should be honest and tell his/her spouce they may carry certain genetic risk that may affect their offsprings .
However , there are two sides of stories always .
Genectic testing is a personal decision , with the kowledge that there is a possiblity that one could be a carrier or not .
However , if a dignosed carrier is obligated to tell his or her relatives , the relatives will be forced to know their higher chance of being genetic risk carriers .
We all know that life is priceless and we have no right to judge a person 's death .
And I am able to easily find a common topic when I contact them .
That is because we are acting who we are in reality while we have no reason to do that in the online virtual world .
This will result in unnecessary conflicts between two parties over miscommunication .
They can also take immediate measures to reduce the possibility of having this disease .
The social media is beneficial as it connect you and your loved one even though you are separated by the distance .
And now I got over 500 friends on Facebook and buried myself with hundrends of seeds every day .
Some people who are try to talk in the public can also actively take part in the group chatting via social media .
What 's more , these days social media plays an important role in spreading the information .
But they are all from one family and own the same forefather , then of course they own the same genes in some part .
So , they have to also prepare mentally .
'Privacy ' , this is the word that popular in these few decades .
From this scope , social media has shorten our distance .
In the sophisticated era like these days , experts keep producing inventions that are meant to make life easier .
There are advantages and disadvantages in itself , however , whether it is good or bad we are still not sure .
This knowledge maybe relavant to them , and vice versa .
This is related to the interpersonal skill that is mentioned before , that can be decreasing qualitatively if we are used to facing gadget , not facing human being .
No more worries about the time it takes to deliver letters and packages .
This means both of his parents has gene A and they are both under high risk of having disease C. They could save the cost of runing two separate tests to see whether they are under high risk of having disease C. If he runs a test and know that he has the gene Aa .
Therefore I think a know genetic risk should not be obligated to tell his or her family or relatives .
The carrier should be honest with his or her feeling and I find that it is the right of the family member to know what is going on to his or her life .
If anything wrong happened to the carrier 's life , without informing the family members it could make a huge regret in their life if she leaves without them knowing about it .
An extremely interesting and ironic phenomenon was discovered that a group of friends met and sat around one table , but none of them were really chatting with one another .
Without the support of loved ones , patients ' life is no better than death .
Thus I believe that social media sites are one of useful tool to help people known each other better .
How do social media help change our lives ?
It is a mental unhealth and it may trigger people especially teenagers to become material .
As citizens of a nation , they have the responsibility to support their country in many ways .
On the other hand , it may pass the disease to the next generation if the carrier hides the truth .
However , calling a person by using a phone and writing a person a letter require some cost , and sending a letter to a person who live far away , especially in villages , takes much time .
In this case , the carrier can eat less candies and chocolates to prevent intake to much sugars , and at the same time , if the carrier tell this information to the relatives , it will be useful for them to know that they may have diabetes in the future becouse of related genes and they can perform the same exercise to intake less sugar to prevent the disease .
Also , as numerous profit-driven companies realize the hugh human traffic on such social media sites , they make it as a pond to fish the customers by uploading many advertisements .
However , its disadvantages also can not be ingnored when you cosider it as a platform to show off and a stage for cyber crime .
If the knowledge of the genetic risk was to be shared within the family or relatives , there might have chances for them to have it in their blood , which they may do necessary precautions to prevent .
The opposite is also true .
We tend to only share our happy moments in media .
From the above two points of view I think social media could forge more interest-based friendships .
As this happens , users are more and more pron to any possible frauds .
Since ancient times , human interact with others face by face .
In this modern world , the technologies were improved a lot compared with the last century .
Other than that , sometimes the message of one party can not be delivered properly to the other one since the communication is done through written language , and thus the 'tone ' of the message sent and when it is received may be different .
They will feel it becomes difficult for them to find any topics to communicate with other people .
Firstly , I believe most of us will agree with the sentences below : " I will be anxious about my families when he or she told me that he or she was a carrier of a known genetic risk " .
However , there are many problems againt the execution of asking a carrier to tell his or her ralatives the cause of his or her diseases .
First , with the function of social media sites that connects the people , everyone is able to interact and communicate with friends and families , or even strangers without any time and place constraints .
One of the significant advantages of using a popular social media site is that people can reach other easily , even without contact for a long time .
However happy they were before , there would be some barrier appears which will truly destroy the family gradually .
In most of the countries , there is an emergence of social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter .
There is a story of a girl who lives in social media world every night in eight years .
As a result , it could affect their lives and studies .
Hypertension can be caused by genetic problems which make the carrier harder to digest the fat and salt in blood which can cause hypertension .
Nowadays , the use of the sociall media platforms is a commonplace in our lives .
In conclusion,the state should have passed a legal bill to measure and provide information to doctors that till which extend should a doctor opt to reveal to relatives members about the genetic disease and in which situations it is open to patient 's decision.In addition,the state could also encourage to create assistance schemes to aid necessary help to needy patients to encourage them to open up for the benefit of own and family members.Although it may face challenges from social ethic issues,in a long term,with appropriate encouragement and aid from the government,more individuals would have a different view of acceptance and take appropriate measurements to protect their own health and their loved ones .
Secondly , genetic diseases costs highly for the treatment and medication .
Furthermore , the convenience of social media is also its weakness .
One can not truly understand a person with only stalking his/her facebook page where he/she carefully chooses what to present .
For the countries like Singapore , they are short of manpower to contribute to the nation .
Firstly , interpersonal skills may be affacted by the reduction in face-to-face human contact .
This would avoid the rise of more family-related ethical dilemma .
All of us are living in the technology realm society .
Nowadays , as the technology is becoming increasingly advanced , more and more social media sites are showing up in our daily life .
This is because it is part of everyone 's habit to check their facebook 's page as their friends will post something new every second .
Hence , social media has benefited the masses by equipping them with a powerful tool to disseminate information almost immediate to the people around them .
However , from the ethical point of view .
For example , if an unmarried person has gene Aa and gene aa is sufficient for a very seriou disease .
If the result turned out something that the carrier can not accept then it would have been better not knowing the truth .
As a result , it is important for people to know that we need to be cautious about the time we spend on these social media .
Hence , our social circle is indeed expanding .
One definitely has the right to disclose his or her health issues to anyone , but it 's also one 's responsibility to inform the family and close relatives .
A group of friends having high tea in a caf é without chatting as well , because they do not know what to talk but pressing on their display screen .
Overall , I belive that it entirely depends on the carrier to share the hard facts and face it with relatives but he has no obligation to tell still .
It shortens the distance between people from all over the world and makes instant communication possible .
I believe that most of us agree with these terms .
Many advantages are given to the users .
I personally think this ist he right purpose of going through the genetic testing , so that a family who can not afford to have a disabled kid do not have to give birth to their child and make the entire family suffer .
As a result , social media helps them do the jobs but indirectly affects their interpersonal skills .
The danger of such media socialisation is the uncertainty of such communication due to lack of physical interaction .
In fact , I strongly think that the carrier should weigh both the positive and negative consequences of taking the genetic testing and tak an appropriate action to the results .
The notion of authority also extended 'vertically' .
Moreover , in the world we are living today , many miscarriages conducted in hospital every day .
There is a situation where a family is having a dinner together in a restaurant but everybody is busy with their own gadget , posting picture in Facebook , updating status on Twitter , or even chatting with friends .
Albinism is one of the examples .
Nowadays , thanks to the help of social media , with just one click , you can contact your family and friends wherever you want .
However , there are arguments that social media life brings in a reduction in face-to-face human contact , which in turn affects interpersonal skills .
Many syndromes such as Down Syndrome and Taylor Syndrome can be prevented to happen if the mother undergo proper medication and do n't consume harmful goods during the pregnancy period .
On another hand , we could update our profile by posting on the wall and our friends could read up on the newsfeed .
Some will wish to keep it to themselves and hope to ensure that they will not bring in any pessimism into their family .
Though social media need not be necessarily bad , it must be used accordingly - for work , family , friends .
This had caused panic among the people who had flooded the local police department with numerous phone calls , and this had resulted temporarily closed of schools .
When our phones are accidentally done , we can also use the social media to get contact with our friends .
In addition , though it can be possible in some cases that he or she and the family can undergo specific discrimination in employment and their social life , how people can face more dramatic tragedy such as sickness or death if they can not even overcome this harsh situation .
Researches show that face-to-face meeting frequency among people that are addicted to social media sites has been decreasing .
Firstly , someone having what kinds of disease belongs to his or her privacy .
A lot of people use their true information on social media sites , which can lead to crimes and deception .
Because of this , other people start to think that our lives are full of happiness with no problem at all .
The debatable question , an ethical dilemma , is that are people responsible for telling their relatives that they carry a known genetic risk ?
The results are disclosed to husbands and wifes .
There are about 50 % of the people who have learnt about breaking news from social media .
This is because by the ease of technology such as airplane , some of our friends might be going overseas to continue their studies or even you are away from your family to pursue your studies or even careers in life .
For an example , if exercising is helpful for family potential disease , we can always look for more chances for the family to go exercise .
Secondly , the social media sites can not only connect people with their friends closely .
One of the examples is the 2012 riots happened in Egypt and Zambia .
In addition , doctors usually quote a statement , " Prevention is better than curation " ; this gives us an idea that preventing a disorder to happen has far more advantages than curing it .
Howard Garner mentioned that the different intelligences can be charted , in accordance of utilising tests , and ranked .
This has been indicated in a report done by Boston University in 2012 , 80 % of information posted online is true while a person may like 3 out of 10 times in real life .
And if you are not on it , you will just get lost .
Third , it is hard to define relatives .
Therefore , there is need to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of social media .
With regard to this choice given , there must be some rules to regulate and exercise personal freedom of decision making .
Firstly , genetic testing is not something that is compulsory .
Some people fake their identities in media sites so that they can know more people or some may even cheat others .
However , as we then tend to spend too much time on this and have significantly reduced in face-to-face human contact , that eventually affects our interpersonal skills .
For example , we tend send a birthday wishes when Facebook promts us " Today is someone 's birthday " .
Fundamentally , those who scored lower ranking for interpersonal skills are more likely to stumble when this skill is needed .
This is due to people spending comparatively more time on social networking than time on reading newpapers .
When people around us know that we got certain disease , their altitudes will be easily changed , whether caring us too much or keeping away from us .
One of them is that it reduce the level of concentration especially among the youngsters .
If the person tell their relatives that he or she carries a disease gene , his or her relatives can go to hospital to check whether they also get a disease gene .
Admittedly , it is a social obligation to be responsible for the life of other people .
Lastly , it is easy for people to waste a lot of time using social media .
Firstly of all , social media can make it more convenient for people to make friends and contact each other .
Secondly , although social network takes time for people to chat online but not face to face , they may still decide a time online to meet others face to face in the daily life .
Since some of the information has already been revealed on the home page , it is also easier to find some common topics to talk about .
Moreover , telling their family members the truth is the fastest and easiest way to get their support .
What 's more they may undergo genetic test as well to see whether they are carrying it or not which is also better for them .
Tell them or keep this secret until we die ?
Then it becomes troublesome about whether we need to tell our relatives who may carry this genetic risk as well .
Or they can choose to keep silent until the next carrier is diagnosed .
There are always newspaper report that a new born baby has be abandoned at hospital after they realized the baby have diseases that need a huge amount of money to secure .
This will then could lead to stress as these students are not able to cope with their studies because they were distracted .
It can help us know more about each other .
The medical authorities claimed that only the individual who is at risk for a genetic disorder can make the decision to undergo genetic testing .
In this case , the social network helps people to increase the frequency of talk .
Early pre-examination is healthy as it will cast away unwanted doubts and affect the psychological thoughts of those who are affected .
Therefore my Manager would not miss the moments of her daughter 's growth .
This skill requires practices and can not be done completely through social media .
However , some people worry that social network can affect interpersonal skills as it reduces face-to-face human contact .
However , communication on social media is largely based on " broadcasting and listening " .
It provides people with more convenient contact environment and improve the frequency of meeting with each others .
From the legal aspect , the answer is no but from the ethical aspect , the answer should be yes .
Being in Asian society where genetic testing is not a common practice , I do think that it is the choice of the patient whether he or she wants to tell his or her relatives about his or her disease .
While most people agree that each individual has his own right to decide whether to undergo a genetic test or not , they have different stands in whether it is the patient 's responsibility or freedom to share the result with his or her relatives .
People can use the information to deceive family and friends and banks to do bad things such as blackmail , ATM theft and so on .
In conclusion , we could tell the benefits of telling genetic risk to the carriers relatives overweights the costs .
And there are two basic reasons .
Through those sites we are able to talk to them , to know what their activities are and who their friends are , etc. From the surface point of view it is no doubt that these sites help us to have a better relationship with our relatives despite of the distance .
Do one who suffered from this disease keep it a secret of infrom their relatives ?
In the days without the social networks , people may not have the chance to know others from different countries or the ones they never meet before .
Once the test is done , whether the results should be open to his or her relatives has caused social extensive controversy .
Genetic risk refers more to your chance of inheriting a disorder or disease .
In this case , if one of the family members or close relatives is found to carry genetic risk , it is better for the patient to tell his/her close relatives about the issue and let others known about the risk so that his/her familay members are able to perform some daily excesses to prevent the potential disease or they may go to hospital and check for the correspongding flows .
In a nutshell , a carrier of a known genetic risk has the responsibility to tell his or her relatives .
He or she has the right not to tell anyone .
If we tell them , they may start paying more attention to their daily habits like eating less sugar contained food and keeping a good mood .
At the same time , we are prepared to know when there are other members got this disease .
Generally people need they eyes to look at the display screen of their phone or computer and fingers to manipulate the corresponding device .
Besides , there are more people shwing their pictures of yummy food or travelling experience .
Take H1N1 as an example , all the people in Singapore including students at school , travelers at the Changi Airport , workers in the office as well as passengers on the street are forced by law to take their temperature and report the result to the relevant government authority in charge .
For every action there is always pros and cons .
Sometimes I even canoot sleep well because of excitement .
Teenagers may believe these people and easily be cheat and lose money even their safe .
In comparison , in the field of genetic testing which enables people to be aware of the risk of a possible genetic disorder , as the technology has been very mature already , an even more popular topic arises .
Everyone does not want to see the scene of the broken family due to the carrier of a known genetic risk .
Genetic disorder inheritance is generation by generation , but not all of the offsprings show the relevant symptoms .
When they grow up , they take care of the old parents and thank for their dedication .
More and more networking has been transferred to internet from real life .
With the nature that the results will be known once the tests are done , each individual that is diagnosed to be a genetic risk carrier face an ethical problem : They should warn their relatives about the risking of being the same genetic risk carrier .
For example , diabetes is a kind of genetic disease .
For more convenience , sentences are shortened to simply three or four words such as lol ( which means laugh intensively ) and " asap " ( which means as soon as possible ) .
Then his or her mother will also know the emotion and feel warm .
Therefore , the social media is not safe which is bad to teenager 's future development .
So for the consideration for the other family members , the relatives should be informed .
In some cases , a carrier can suffer tension within a family because the result is also related to the others ' risk somehow .
Firstly , they have lost the courage to meet strangers , not even the courage to talk .
No pledge of authenticity risks people 's information and privacy that are shared on social media sites .
Some family may feel hurt , with regards to their family pride or reputation , on having the knowledge of such genetic disorder running in their family .
Social media does have some other advantages beside their general benefits to human being .
We broadcast these facades of us to others .
It is becoming even more convinient than talking throught the phone since it is free .
They can even make new friends over similar interests on these platforms , which will be able to connect almost everyone closely in many parts of the world .
The child with genetic risk may not have the ability to work , to build up the family with the others and most of the time they are not acceptable for the majority .
Facebook is like a combination of message and chatting service , personal profile , media of sharing , and other entertainment add-on ( i.e .
Some scholars argue that the usage of social media reduces the face-to-face connection between human .
There also exists some probability of wrong testing .
People used to write letters and send post cards to keep in touch with ones live far away from them in the past .
The advantages and disadvantages of using such social media in the society are elaborated on as follows .
In retrospect , its is also ones duty to ensure that he or she undergo periodic healthchecks in their own .
As the consequence , it affects their interpersonal skills .
There are advantages and disadvantages in this change .
Twitter only allow users to give update that is limited to short sentences in order to spread the words fast , that only highlighted messages are delivered .
Many people argue that this is the most serious problem brought by social media sites .
Many of them are busy in work and separate with their children .
By typing the words and showing the pictures , people can express their emotions that they are too shy to express .
Nowadays we can not really trust new people whom we know from social media since we will never know whether they are even 'real' .
It makes people feel extreme close to their admirers ' lives and works .
We can not be certain for sure the reliabilty or truth of some posts or information we received through the Inetrnet .
Without the facial impression , it is easier to misunderstand the intention of speakers .
People get certain disease because of genetic changes .
Young people can widen their relationships , meet new friends and learn wonderful things in many parts of the world .
From the example that I have mentioned earlier we can see that distance between us and our loved one are getting further apart .
Therefore , this advantage of social media sites saves money and time , and also provides convenience for many people .
A Carrier of a Known Genetic Risk Should be Obligated to Tell His or Her Relatives
However , is it the same when we keep in touch with someone virtually compared to when we meet them personally ?
As they are so used to having an online avatar , they may lose their self-identity in real life and may not realise how to interact people in real-life .
Otherwise , if the other parties did not know , they may end up with to have diabete in the future without any prevention .
I noticed a real story on newspaper years ago .
However , the friendship on such virtual world is so superficial which is not so relevant to the real-life .
If there is no problem , that will be wonderful .
Many people may support with a theory that every people have their right to enjoy the world , especially people with religions .
However , I believe it is just a usual reaction to this situation .
There are really a lot of things we need to consider .
In the age of rapid technological advancement , a lot of medical breakthroughs are made possible .
Then eventually , she discovered that eight people became one as he was using eight different identities to chat with her all the time .
As a result , what should we do ?
social games ) which allow users to communicate with remote people , and also to update and express themselves at the same time .
It can take a few days or weeks for those to receive the messages .
Only by absorbing the essence and discarding the dregs can we make better use of the social media .
Ultimately , one must bring attention to who may benefit from such information and assisting those at risk to make considered decisions about disclosure .
I agree with this statement to a large extent .
However , some people may argue that why we want to interfere with their lives ?
By doing so , one will feel less stressful in facing such disorder risk .
From a practitioner 's perspective these findings are important because if lay constructs of the family and kinship are a social construct they may not be in line with geneticists ' views of family relationships , or about which blood ( or non-blood ) relatives should be informed and by whom ; this is also likely to be dependent on the cultural and ethnic context .
Teenagers are developing their interpersonal skills and social skills when they are growing up .
Maybe after we tell them , they will go for it and know more about themselves .
Geographical and transportation borders are not a problem anymore because communication and information technologies were enhanced continuously .
The benefits of doing so are able to outweigh its disadvantages .
I believe 80 percents of people plays social media sites .
If a gene runs in the family , one of the family member test positive , whom does he need to tell .
The appearance of social media sites truly connects people closely .
This is not the case I am talking about here .
Just as the lyrics of Kelly Clarkson , what does n't kill you make you stronger .
If your wife is not aware of the truth and give birth to the baby , it will be possible for your child to carry the same genetic risk as well .
However , there rises a family-related ethical dilemma if it is right to tell a carrier 's family once the test has been conducted and the results are known .
It is againt his or her human rights and it is against the law 's spirit .
Since this will really affect their lives , what we should do is to try to make it in a positive way .
For people who are living very far from one another , the intensive use social media is justified .
On the other hand , with the help of social media , some homeless people or someone who need the money to cure the disease can get the help from the world quickly because once one person know the information , his or her will share it to their " friends area " , then many people will know it and spread the information to the person who can give help .
However , they behave quite boring when I talk to them in real life .
Nowadays , what people need to do is just typing in front of the computer in their own rooms .
People may feel angry , depressed , or even guilty about their results .
Finally , the technology of testing the gene is not very mature now .
Therefore , to keep the information as secret to his/her future spouce would help the relationship .
It is easier for people to approach the other after knowing the information .
The parents are now the " friends " of their kids , and they can now " follow " their kids more closely and on real time .
In the past , vast communication are done by one of the many such a telegram , snail mail and poor-quality voice calls .
We may meet only once but we exchange our contact numbers as well as facebook account in order to keep in touch .
If the disorder symptoms reflect on a kid , the parent will be informed by the medics for sure , then the whole family will stay alert to their bodies ' condition .
However , in the case pertaining to any health issue or to the extent of serious disorder , it may seems no point of sharing but this involves more than just sharing of bad news .
Besides , we can make more friends by such interactions when our friends also bring their friends in .
With the families ' support , there must be more energy to fight against with the demon .
Today , social media sites , such as Facebook and Twitter , are relatively common within the contemporary society ; and , people can communicate with each other , online or offline , on these social networking platforms .
There may be possibilities when both the husband and wife are carriers and therefore they should not have any child since their child may not be able to survive even after they are born .
"
The next two paragraphs will be discussing about the advantages and disadvantages of using social media in our society .
On social media , everyone is a broadcaster and a viewer .
However , there may be some special case that is hard to be defined .
When we write or communicate virtually , we can hide our through feelings and many not become ourselves since we do not want the other party to judge us .
Social media sites such as Facebook has allow us to share our pictures or even chat online with our parents while we are overseas .
In my opinion , as long as we keep our mind healthy and strong , we can fight any disease as they come to us when we are fragile and weak .
This lowers the experience of human ability to interact with one another which can adversely shape one 's behaviour .
They may collect information about that person by asking his friends , colleagues or family members .
People are able to share the culture or pretty photos online , therefore others can spread the joy with them .
Disadvantages : One of the main concerns of using social media platform to communicate is credibility .
As far as I am concerned , when a couple are going to have babies , they are going to run a few tests and see whether their could have some genetic diseases .
Secondly , it helps people to keep in-touch with one another .
As a conclusion , once you have undergone the genetic testing and being aware of carrying some specific genetic risk , there are responsibilities to your relatives , yourself , and your following generations by telling your relatives and families the truth .
For example , does the carrier only need to tell his or her direct relatives like parents and brothers and sisters or does he also need to tell relatives like his grandmother 's sister 's son 's daughter 's nephew ?
Social media has reshaped the way of communication .
I get news for sales , clothes and cosmetics from my friends .
Depending on whom the genetic risk was discovered from : the son or daughter for example , the parents who knows about this would decide who gets told and whom takes the precedence in being 'allowed ' to tell .
Nevertheless , while I fell that a carrier should not be obligated to tell his or her relatives about the genetic risk , I would like to suggest the person to at least share the information with her or his potential partner ( husband or wife ) since the individual 's genetic risk may affect their future children .
Without increasing number of disables in a nation , the government is able to concentrate to develop in other ways like military and education .
The burgeoning of social media definitely has its stint ; but amongst all good things , it is better to have them in moderation .
The lost of interpersonal skills results in the inability for people to well present their ideas .
We share ideas , stories and forge friendship based on mutual respect .
While every family need to go through this or that kind of troublesome situations , the more troubles that a family has gone through together , the greater bond will be established between the family members as well as the greater amount of trust , love and understanding .
We communicate with others using social media , such as twitter , facebook and microblog more and more frequently .
The communication does not focus on how we feel , or to say , each otherm , but whatever is interesting , or the content .
In addition , " social media sites will affect writing skills " , that is the point of view in society .
In conclusion , the shadow always exists when there is light .
A father may be able to make a call to his daughter who is in other country via socia media software instead of making international call which costs a lot to normal salary family .
Firstly , social media brings convenience to the world .
The situation may become worst if the child has diseases like cancer or heart disease , which means that parents have another heavy baggage named medication fees .
But , there will still be unreliable sources spreading false information on social media sites despite high security to control almost every social networking movement .
Therefore there is nothing to be shy for or be afraid of .
They take too much time of using online social network and thus do not have time to have their daily meeting with people in their real life .
As a part of this modern society , we should learn to distinguish between good and bad impacts brought by the advancement of technologies , and also learn to avoid the cons and maximize the benefits of those sites .
If you have n't undergone the genetic testing , it 's just odd and fate for what will happen to both of you and your relatives .
As for the advantages , there are two aspects : more convenient to contact others , easier to know about others .
People connecting through the social media sites can spend no money on the communication , and also take only one or a few seconds for the message to reach .
We found that we actually are the genetic risk carrier .
They pointed that actually social media reduces the chance for us to talk to people around us face to face .
Their number of people that they know may only limited to the people they meet in daily life like classmates and working partners .
Even for those patients with terminal diseases , the duration of their survival is 30 % longer due to the family support .
And if the results turn out to be otherwise , then the family can be prepared emotionally and psychologically of the future outcome and aid them in making upcoming decisions .
The types of use must also be taken note of - informing , interacting , discussion and others .
In a nutshell , our society ca n't push genetic problem carrier to tell his or her disease to his or her relatives but he or she should be willing to tell his or her relatives about his or her genetic problem .
Some people might say that it is a form of prevention of giving birth to disabled lives and making them suffer in real-life .
Social network sites provides us many convenience .
Social media definitely has some other strong benefits that make the users stay is the links among the people .
Socia media allows them to explain to or inform people what is going on .
Hence , they will be able to seek help from medical specialists to find a cure or to do some measures to prevent the risk of getting the disease .
Or in a less extreme case , the child may be disabled .
The relation between parents and children is something about love and dedication .
In addition , there are also some false reports and fake IDs occur on both social media sites that people use fake ID to insult or harass someone , like the case of Heather Chua occurred recently on Facebook .
Nowadays , people can just easily put their renting information on their facebook account and wait for the response from others who are from different parts of the world which brings us a huge amount of convenience .
Hence , there were also tensions if participants felt that they could neither pass on information to relatives who needed to know ( such as nieces and nephews ) nor persuade those with authority ( the parents ) to do so .
Human has their own rights and privacy .
The obvious disadvantage of using social media is that the time reduction on face-to-face contact .
With the welcoming of application such as Skype and Facetime , any individual can phase off most , of the olden days communication methods .
For example , if you find out one of your friend 's favourite singer is Justin Biber through facebook , you can give him or her Justin Biber 's new album or concert ticket as a birthday gift .
With the sharing of personal photos , posting of status of one 's personal feeling or experience and able to reply to these posts allowed human interaction to be engage and expand with ease .
The society will adapt to such phenomenon as physical interaction are transformed into cyber interaction .
This kind of behaviour is not good to people 's psychological health according to a research .
There may be some people who say that it is necessary to tell the family members about the risk since some of them may be affected , while I do think that this view has a point , how much you can trust your family regarding this issue may also be a case .
In a conclusion , there are both advantages and disadvantages of using social media in daily life .
Sometimes it becomes extremely hard for them to accept this news especially if they are going to know that they or their descendants may have a severe disease like blood disease which is untreatable .
To those family members who care about them , it is also a moral obligation .
And actually lots of rescuing jobs are done with the help of social media like looking for people get lost and so on .
Particularly , in the medical field , there is a great improvement in many treatments for many formally incurable diseases , and genetic testing is one of the methods which were used to diagnose an individual at risk for a genetic disorder .
Firstly , the information concerning to the genetic is something personally which is also a privacy like people 's bank card key .
In conclusion , the showing up of social media sites is a double edged sword .
It is an obligation for a carrier to inform his relatives , but also an obligation for a family member to liven up the family .
It is not a heavy job for the family if they have prepare their mental first by disclosing the information of the probability that their children may suffer from the genetic disorder .
It also brings many negative effects such as loss of face-to-face communicating skills which is important in their working place .
Without hanging out with friends or talking with friends through phone , we can know his of her latest news by scaning the webpage .
