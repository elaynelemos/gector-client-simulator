In addition , the genetic risk carrier would be showered with moral and emotional support from their relatives if it is been made known to them .
When we are diagonosed out with certain genetic disease , are we suppose to disclose this result to our relatives ?
Therefore , it would be better for the carrier to be obligated to tell the information to the relatives , in order to let them know and prevent the potential disease through daily exercises .
Afterall , what affects one family may or may not affect another although the families has a common genetic make up , shared by either of the parents .
We can not deny that the social media sites truly make the old friends do not lose the information and the chances to communicate with you even you are in a different country .
On the one hand , it can tell members of the carrier 's family the possible disease they may have and can perform treatment in time if possible .
Social media sites suppose be a very useful and convenient tool to use and bring people get closer in this globalised world .
Seconly , the relatives of the carrier can also choose to do genetic testing regardless of the dignosis of the carrier .
One definitely has the right to disclose his or her health issues to anyone , but it 's also one 's responsibility to inform the family and close relatives .
The question is whether a carrier of a known genetic risk should tell his or her relatives .
To prevent the bigger problem to happen , it takes a lot of effort to take care of your body .
Advantages : Social media sites have greatly ease long distance communication and interaction due to its accessibility and convenience .
However , as we then tend to spend too much time on this and have significantly reduced in face-to-face human contact , that eventually affects our interpersonal skills .
Nevertheless , it will depend on what kind of genetic diseases , given in the context of current medical technology .
So all the married couples go run a test and know they are not carriers.They might subconsiously see him as different and worry that he will find a wife who will carry this gene as well .
The basis of a family is that everyone trusts and love each other with no doubts .
The obvious disadvantage of using social media is that the time reduction on face-to-face contact .
Actually , I have seen some people are very funny and interesting when I am chatting with them online .
Firstly , what is the range of the relatives ?
As a result , people think of theirselves lowly and may lead to depression and mental disorder .
It is therefore I would agree for the obligation of telling the relatives of both parties when one is about to get married and have a plan for giving birth .
Many of them are busy in work and separate with their children .
Though because of this , social media is still a much fairer and more transparent online platform for the public to share ideas compared to other traditional medias .
They will consider whether to give a birth to a new baby because of this genetic problem and they will start finding ways to try to avoid their baby to carry this genetic risk as well .
The wolrd is incresingly becoming flat by all kinds of social network website such as facebook and twitter .
This allows friends that may not have the time for meet up to still connected in a way .
And the information collected may not be intact and true .
All of us are living in the technology realm society .
They are just scrolling down pages of pages of pictures and statuses and see one of them which they might think it funny .
As a conclusion , once you have undergone the genetic testing and being aware of carrying some specific genetic risk , there are responsibilities to your relatives , yourself , and your following generations by telling your relatives and families the truth .
Secondly , the carrier of a known genetic risk may destroy the peace of a family even broken the relation between children with the adult .
As this happens , users are more and more pron to any possible frauds .
This essay will illustrate in two aspects .
Social media enables us to explore the world far far away without paying expensive airplane tickets and sparing a one-week holiday .
We spend majority of our time on sites like Facebook , Twitter and it affects our daily work productivity and performance .
However happy they were before , there would be some barrier appears which will truly destroy the family gradually .
With the help of social media site , people are able to upload their new discoveries and funny scene on it and they can be updated the new information of their friends .
I think the family will stay mentally healty as it is , without having emtional stress .
Updated news people care about can be easily obtained when you refresh your social media sites on your smart phones and laptops almost every time at any time .
Some people spend a lot of time in it and forget their real life .
People connecting through the social media sites can spend no money on the communication , and also take only one or a few seconds for the message to reach .
In conclusion , everything has two sides of stories .
After he takes the test and be obliged to tell his relatives , everyone know that he is a carrier .
It is normal for people to demand for a fair and similar treatment as the others and therefore it is normal for people to try to keep some of their secrets or personal issues to themselves in case some people judge them or treat them differently.Many people really love to hear what they want to hear and therefore they may just ignore the word 'risk ' and assume that the person has suffered from the disease .
This essay will illustrate the pros and cons of using social media in modern society .
It means that one can not know another 's real thought and personalities by reading things that he or she put on social network media .
By typing the words and showing the pictures , people can express their emotions that they are too shy to express .
This is because many relate genetic diseases to those such as Bubble-Boy disease , autism or down-syndrome .
Although sometimes those genuine sharing of information may be inappropriate or even harmful , such as prevalent using of vulgarity and harsh-meaning comments , we can minimize those repercussions through strict regulations of content online .
As stated above , I strongly believe that if we can use social media wisely rather than abusing it , we will all live a better life .
They can learn how these people succeed and they can also have the chance to talk with them and know these famous persons ' thought by using the social media .
Secondly , without the truly communication in the real life , people lose the ability to see the truth and false .
As citizens of a nation , they have the responsibility to support their country in many ways .
With the wide spread of advanced technology , social media sites are becoming more and more popular .
And also , we get a chance to talk to public people like popular stars and know their life better .
Furthermore , living with a secret is not a good sensation , especially if the situations of other relatives become worse , you should feel guilty and depressed .
I get news for sales , clothes and cosmetics from my friends .
If they do n't treat their body well , such as by using sunglasses or wearing sunscreen in outdoor , the chances are good that they will get skin problems that may also lead to cancer .
While every family need to go through this or that kind of troublesome situations , the more troubles that a family has gone through together , the greater bond will be established between the family members as well as the greater amount of trust , love and understanding .
In China , a lot of government organizations have open blogs to communicate with people , like firefighters , police stations and so on .
In addition , there are also chances for people to miscommunicate with each other as they can not sense the tone of the other party over social media platforms .
In the chat room , she created a close relationship with eight people .
Genetic disorder may or may not be hirataged hereditary disease and it is sometimes hard to find out one has these kinds of diseases .
In most of the countries , there is an emergence of social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter .
First and foremost , I would like to share on the advantages of using such social media in my daily life .
Lying on the bed for the remaining life , and even die immediately , these are the consequences which we can not imagine .
It is not a heavy job for the family if they have prepare their mental first by disclosing the information of the probability that their children may suffer from the genetic disorder .
Students can exchange their experiences in study even they are in different countries .
Hence , it is essential to tell their family members about the risk of their genetic disorder both as a social responsibility and a favor to conserve the family basis .
As a result , what should we do ?
They are too busy with their way too many virtual friends and some of them neglect the feelings of their real-life friends .
It can make people become closer as well .
We share ideas , stories and forge friendship based on mutual respect .
By telling to his or her family other than being a support , they could possibly help her to get alternative solutions to the problem that she is facing right now .
It is better to let the other party know the fact than after the baby is born and certain type of genetic disease is found .
The benefits of doing so are able to outweigh its disadvantages .
The opposite is also true .
Hence , our social circle is indeed expanding .
They have the right to know whether they are at risk .
People get connected or closer with same preferences .
In conclude , socia media benefits people in several ways but in the same time harms people .
If the wife had not hind the truth and asked for doctor 's advice before they have baby , the tragic would not happen .
Above all , social network site is like a two sided knife and people can only take good advantage of it by avoiding the possible disadvantages of it such as put less personal information on his or her facebook page .
Without increasing number of disables in a nation , the government is able to concentrate to develop in other ways like military and education .
Third , it is hard to define relatives .
For an example , one is able to send notifications and other information we use to have them in hardcopy previously , over the web and the process takes seconds .
Some people will to post their expensive thing or the oversea places of interest they have been on the social network and get a feeling of satisfaction by doing so .
On the other side , we need to rethink about the influences brought by the social media .
However , social media may do some harm to people 's life .
Lastly , it is easy for people to waste a lot of time using social media .
After got the divorce certificate , the man showed her the test report ; it wrote that the woman carried the disease gene instead of the man .
Therefore , once people find they have carried the disease genes , they should be responsible to tell their relatives , at least their family members .
These advantages also comes in handy as most of these social media sites are accessible through mobile application in our smartphones .
This means both of his parents has gene A and they are both under high risk of having disease C. They could save the cost of runing two separate tests to see whether they are under high risk of having disease C. If he runs a test and know that he has the gene Aa .
How can a law made by government exempt such a group of people from preparing to face their potetial disease ?
People may feel angry , depressed , or even guilty about their results .
Moreover , some wrong values on the websites will affect teenagers and confuse them .
People usually get this kind of hypertesion after they become adult .
When one of his friends who is not aware of this has failed to contact him via telephone calls , he might be able to get his whereabout using social media .
It not only is convenient and beneficial in connecting people and developing the business but it also can damage people relationships and interpersonal skills .
As a student , I tend to meet lots of people from different background and at different settings .
The audience is not some specific person , but everyone we might know , or even the entire world .
It makes people worry since if all the teenagers continue using social media frequently , they will decrease the ability to talk to people .
What we can do is to cautiously manage our time spent online and manage our words used online .
Online friends became real life friends and real life friends communicate with one another online .
Surrounded by such concerns , it is very likely that we are distracted to worry about these problems .
From the example that I have mentioned earlier we can see that distance between us and our loved one are getting further apart .
It is hereditary .
When we write or communicate virtually , we can hide our through feelings and many not become ourselves since we do not want the other party to judge us .
People can promote their friendship and relationship through these social media .
Due to the popularity of social media , many people start to do their business via these sites .
Some people might say that it is a form of prevention of giving birth to disabled lives and making them suffer in real-life .
My answer is no .
Above all , life is more important than secret .
With this situation , both advantages and disadvantages of using social media apply to our daily life .
The lost of interpersonal skills results in the inability for people to well present their ideas .
Nowadays , with the development of technology and society , social media become more popular and even important in our daily life .
This will greatly help a society to progress rapidly .
The images we choose to present are tentatively considered .
It saves a lot of money and time as well as strengthen our relationship although we stay at different places around the world .
It is able to detect the illnesses or diseases and even a child 's parentage .
After came back from the hospital , the man told his parents that the problem was that he carried a disease gene so that they can not have a baby in their life time .
In business area , social media is a good tool to develop and advertise products and services .
Therefore , I think a known genetic risk should not be obligated to tell his or her family or relatives without the person 's permission .
Furthermore , the annouance of genetic risk would affect the relationship with the relatives as sometimes others may think not to stay too close to the carrier so that they have less chance to get the potential disease .
No matter it is a party , dinner or just simply get-together , there always are some people bow their head and playing their phones even their family and friends are in front of them .
Besides that , company also can use the convenience of social media sites , such as Facebook chat or Skype to facilitate the meeting with parties of project from around the world .
That is why facial impression is one of the most important elements in social learning .
Despite the luxury that is offered by social media , there are also harmful side effects which people may not realize it beforehand .
The importance of informing relatives of such genetic disease is vital as it may help to raise awareness and prevention towards the genetic disorder .
The reason might just be that he or she just wants to " decorate " his or her face .
In old days , if one wants to tell some important news to another one , which lives far away , he needs to write letters and it wastes time .
There are four reasons why people do n't have to be shy and share their problems regarding genetic disorder .
Another problem with social media is that , the benefits from investing such enormous time and energy is not relfected as something positive to the users .
However , there are risks of false information and chances of miscommunication .
In my opinion , the responsibility of telling family and relatives is quite obvious .
It is a common scene that almost everyone in a public transport is watching at phone or wearing a pair ear piece in this modern society today .
May be we can trust our immediate family members but can we really trust all the other relatives ?
Social media enables people from different parts of the world to communicate with one another .
It is still early for parents to decide whether they can foster a new life that are not able to work and may suffer the pain in the entire life .
Sometimes it becomes extremely hard for them to accept this news especially if they are going to know that they or their descendants may have a severe disease like blood disease which is untreatable .
Facebook and Twitter can serve as an alternative route to make connection between us and our old friends .
People should avoid the misuse of socia media and use it in the proper way .
However , it will become a controversial issue as it becomes a dilemma for a carrier of a known genetic risk to inform his or her relatives .
As a result , they will gradually decrease in their ability to compete with each other in the society .
Therefore , everytime when we use social media , we should take both sides into consideration and try to avoid be affected by the disadvantages .
To tell or not to tell
Some of the diseases may not show symptoms until the carrier is old enough .
Some people may say that telling the truth may arise some unnecessary doubts and panics which will endanger the family harmony .
One of the reasons that the parents should be informed is that they have to decide whether they are capable to raise a child with genetic risk .
It involves a level of dynamic interaction which utlises the motor , thinking and verbal cortex of the mind to coordinate .
Take H1N1 as an example , all the people in Singapore including students at school , travelers at the Changi Airport , workers in the office as well as passengers on the street are forced by law to take their temperature and report the result to the relevant government authority in charge .
Furthermore , since many teenagers and young adults are fans of social media , these information can reach them easily without them need to watch or listen to the news reports .
As a result , it is important for people to know that we need to be cautious about the time we spend on these social media .
Especially for the young people without marrige , if he/she is known to have some genetic risk , it may have certain chance that his/her child would carry the same disease , but not in certain .
An extremely interesting and ironic phenomenon was discovered that a group of friends met and sat around one table , but none of them were really chatting with one another .
If certain disease genetic test is very accurate and it is unavoidable and necessary to get treatment and known by others , it is OK to disclose the result .
Or they can choose to keep silent until the next carrier is diagnosed .
Then , we need to talk about the advantages and disadvantages of using social media in your daily life and society .
I know it will have a huge impact on them , but we should know that they are our loved ones , we need to tell them and help them .
Howard Garner studied the effect of multiple intelligences amongst people and stated that interpersonal intelligence is a form of skills on its own - some has it , some does not .
The broadcasting and viewing model is not good for forging relationships .
Nowadays , people can even use their phone to read news and everyone can be the first witnesses of what is happening in the world .
If the carrier refuses to tell the truth to his or her spouse , another life may have risk of inheriting the genetic disease .
Introverts or those who are shy to communicate with their friends are now able to do so in the form of words via social media platform .
There are about 50 % of the people who have learnt about breaking news from social media .
We can not blame them that they are liable to the undesired consequences .
However , it is a good practice not to intesively use social media all the time .
Awareness of having a genetic disorder may help in diagnosing a genetic disorder for a person , and therefore , this may make the prevention of a certain disorder possible .
We can not be certain for sure the reliabilty or truth of some posts or information we received through the Inetrnet .
On the other hand , if the genetic risk is kept as a secret , although it may benefit the carrier to a certain extend and help to keep the privacy , but it has much larger negative impacts to the family members and relatives .
Geographical and transportation borders are not a problem anymore because communication and information technologies were enhanced continuously .
As the development of the technology , social media becomes more and more significant role in the whole world .
Moreover , people can be aware of what is going on in social situation and see the comments online and share their opinions on these websites .
Personally , I strongly agree that social media brings more disadvantages compared to advantages it gives us .
The communication does not focus on how we feel , or to say , each otherm , but whatever is interesting , or the content .
If the carrier does n't tell his or her relatives , it may be too late to get their support and prepare financially .
In conclusion,the state should have passed a legal bill to measure and provide information to doctors that till which extend should a doctor opt to reveal to relatives members about the genetic disease and in which situations it is open to patient 's decision.In addition,the state could also encourage to create assistance schemes to aid necessary help to needy patients to encourage them to open up for the benefit of own and family members.Although it may face challenges from social ethic issues,in a long term,with appropriate encouragement and aid from the government,more individuals would have a different view of acceptance and take appropriate measurements to protect their own health and their loved ones .
And it becomes more convenient to obtain and update information by using social media .
However , people now can contact with anyone all over the world who can use computer at any time , and there is no time delay of messages .
The society will adapt to such phenomenon as physical interaction are transformed into cyber interaction .
Some may say that the appearance for these modern media will reduce the chance for people to communicate face to face .
With the help of social media tools , we can stay in contact and keep ourselves up to date with our family and friends even though we are away from them .
They worry a lot about the bad effect on the teenagers who are still developing themselves .
His relatives can then take measures , if this disease can some how be prevented , to stop this disease from taking their lives .
As explained above , modern and sophisticated technology does n't always give advantages .
It might not be accurate to judge the other party 's feelings over social media as one may cover up their emotions while on social media .
To sum up , a carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to tell his or her relatives .
Therefore , while social media sites are undoubtedly have benefits in our life , we should consider its drawbacks and thus use it wisely so that we can gain more of their benefits and it disadvantages us in the smallest way as possible .
The other reason that parents should know the baby they have is a carrier of genetic risk is for a nation 's good .
Let 's examine the advantages and disadvantages of using social media in our daily life and society .
However , the wife actually had already known about the polygenetic disorder before the marriage and she did not tell her husband .
A lot of people use their true information on social media sites , which can lead to crimes and deception .
Furthermore , this lack of physical interaction has affected human inter-personal behaviour since communication is made through social media instead of meet-ups .
However , in order for people to maintain their relationship as well as making new friends , it requires mutual trust and understanding between both parties .
People can only use electical devices to access internet .
What 's more they may undergo genetic test as well to see whether they are carrying it or not which is also better for them .
These are the advantages that save works most of the time .
In my opinion , the patients , which are carriers of some known genetic risk are supposed to share the truth with their family members .
Many people think that the social media sites have benefits on the communication between people while some others argue that there are several negative impacts for the society .
Tears showed nothing .
Then it becomes troublesome about whether we need to tell our relatives who may carry this genetic risk as well .
For myself , I am long to some places after I saw those beatiful pictures taken by my firneds .
Nowadays , people not only pursuit the comfort of their own life but also a better development of their following generations .
Otherwise , making it an obligation will restric the choice of carriers and bring a lot of confusion to their relatives .
In addition , social network site can help you keep in touch with friends living very far away .
People post about their random thoughts or daily activities via Twitter and post different kinds of photos on Facebook frequently , to be connected with their so called friends .
In the past decades , when the social media sites are not yet fully developed , people connect with others who live far away by using a phone , or even a letter .
The use of social media has largely influenced our ways in communicating with one another .
For an example , if exercising is helpful for family potential disease , we can always look for more chances for the family to go exercise .
As a result , social media helps them do the jobs but indirectly affects their interpersonal skills .
Personally I feel that we still should take our responsibility to tell them the situation .
Nowadays , as the technology is becoming increasingly advanced , more and more social media sites are showing up in our daily life .
From this scope , social media has shorten our distance .
It is not the broadcasters themselves they care about , but the content .
We can know more news and cultures through socia medias .
More and more young people tend to live in social media world most of their time and reduce face-to-face human contact , which can affect interpersonal skills and relationships in social life .
However , if they already know they have a gene that may make them have higher possibilities to get hypertention .
They may do not want this truth to influence their life or want to keep it as a secret and do not others know about it .
Since some of the information has already been revealed on the home page , it is also easier to find some common topics to talk about .
In cases where an individual has gotten to know of a genetic disorder , disclosing or otherwise , to his or her relative is solely a matter of preference within the indivdial moral system .
It is commonly seen in a food court or restaurant that a group of people sitting together around a table with each of them having a cell phone in their hands .
Also , this known information will help their relatives to make informed decisions and tosimilarly undergo genetic testingto find out about the outcome .
Based on the statistic report , the more of the writing skills will be reduced when the more time used in the social media sites .
However , every year the government has to spend a lot to help the disables such as medical subsidizes and builds up special schools to educate them .
When our phones are accidentally done , we can also use the social media to get contact with our friends .
Everyone in the world can not stop using it every day to express their feelings or ideas and a log of other stuff which helps their friends know their lives better .
Nowadays , the use of the sociall media platforms is a commonplace in our lives .
It is the ethic of staff in hospital to keep the secret of any patients .
The users of every social media sites need to strike a balance between the real world versus the virtual one .
Secondly , annouance the potential risk would cause the family member to be scared of this certain issue , although the factor would not be that serious , people would still fear that they would have some potential disease in the future thus go to hospital and do additional check or take more medicine in order to prevent the disease , and this creats unnecessary costs to the family .
If you say only need to tell direct relatives , it will be against the fairness of law .
In conclusion , I think social media has reshaped interpersonal relationships from a more human-based friendship that requires sharing and caring between friends , to a more information-based friendship that requires a mutual interest .
I believe most of us have the experience of suddenly forget how to write a word that we should know .
It is a mental unhealth and it may trigger people especially teenagers to become material .
Keeping the Secret of Genetic Testing
In conclude , people should think carefully of what is the consequences of telling the relatives his or her generic disorder issue .
This is applicable to these social media sites .
However , some people worry that social network can affect interpersonal skills as it reduces face-to-face human contact .
You can share photos , videos and every meaningful experiences of your life .
One of the disadvantage that many people concerns is that people loss the interest of face-to-face communication .
With a globalised and interconnected world today , Twitter and Facebook are now the mainstream platform for social interaction .
Twitter , that has more simplified function compared to Facebook , gives more benefit if used as information sharing media .
There are a lot of disadvantages that people may not realize of .
I think a carrier of a known genetic risk should not be obligated to tell his or her relatives .
A guy who is going travel for months can easily tell all of his friends about his activity .
Some of them may have changed their phone numbers and addresses , and we are not able to find them through a phone or a letter .
For example , if an unmarried person has gene Aa and gene aa is sufficient for a very seriou disease .
The appearance of those social media sites causes those problems to be solved .
However , this can also be achieved from personal choice .
Many of the teenagers today claimed that they are able to keep in touch with their friends through social media , regardless of their location .
Being the parent , you are not responsible to you next generations , since you allow the genetic risk to be passed on by generation and generation and being aware of it .
Although it is really useful when we need to use it to let other people know we really live a good life , it wastes us a lot of time as well .
We should know that although we may affect their lives , we can still let them make correct choices in the future .
In this modern world , the technologies were improved a lot compared with the last century .
This is the common law in the society .
Firstly , when people rely on the social media to communicate with their friends and parents , they will accustom to communicate by typing and not talking .
They may collect information about that person by asking his friends , colleagues or family members .
It will make people spend more time on chatting on the internet rather than communicate face to face such that the interpersonal skill will be badly affected .
You can see people playing Facebook , Twitter through their smart phones or ipad on buses or on trains .
The emotional depression that the carrier might get and the sense of guilty can be more than expected and could be a burden in mind for the rest of the life .
Whenever they need to use social media , they have to use a phone or internet .
Thus , much thought need to put on the immediate family as it could caused a stir of unwanted events from the patient or the family members itself .
Early pre-examination is healthy as it will cast away unwanted doubts and affect the psychological thoughts of those who are affected .
People indeed go to great length to make their words as shorter as they can .
Nowadays , with the advancement of technology , it is easy to communicate wherever you are .
There is a story of a girl who lives in social media world every night in eight years .
Social media are able to improve relationship and make new friends , provided that there is mutual trust and mutual understanding between both parties .
The woman did not know the test result , but she overheard the talk and decided to divorce with her husband .
In this case , interpersonal skill is not as important because our goal is not to impress somebody , but to get the information that we are both interested in .
Nobody can deny social media 's advantages as the benefit it provides in connecting people regardless of nationalities , races , cultures and languages .
Thus , whether there are more advantages or disadvantages becomes a tough question for every human being .
On one side , it is obvioualy that many advantages have been brought to our lives .
It is just because that you do not become strong enough to overcome the hard time .
If the parents know that one of them is a carrier and disclose the information to their relatives then they can bring their children to undergo genetic testing and do n't need to be shy of it because it is for the sake of their children 's health .
First , social media networks have a lot user base , it helps to link people from different parts of the world .
One advantage is that it is more convenience to contact others by social media .
With a small smart phone or a computer at school , at work or at home , we can easily make friends worldwide with a 'click ' and get to know about their life through having conversations with them , reading their blogs , photos and status .
Firstly , genetic testing is not something that is compulsory .
And of course , he or she will think of not having any child after getting married , and the same thought goes to the cousins as well .
Fourthly , it is important for the parents to give mental boost for their children with genetic disorder .
For Facebook , a comprehensive way of sharing is offered since multiple photos and videos can be uploaded , long notes can be published , even documents and data can be shared through Facebook nowadays .
Some people who are try to talk in the public can also actively take part in the group chatting via social media .
Furthermore , with the current technology , smartphones are able to get access to social media sites which have made easier for consumers to use .
This shows that a facebook friend may know more about you than your close friend who does not have a facebook account .
At the same time , we are prepared to know when there are other members got this disease .
Social media sites like Twitter and Facebook are popular among people in order for them to connect to others even from different countries .
It consists of the function of connecting , sharing , interacting and advertising .
Some will take long time and some are not efficient enough for people to get their response .
Nothing is absolute right or wrong .
In conclusion , the showing up of social media sites is a double edged sword .
I could understand the feeling of the carrier .
I believe 80 percents of people plays social media sites .
Thank to those social media , the communication among people all over the world is possible and can be done with ease .
Tell them or keep this secret until we die ?
'Privacy ' , this is the word that popular in these few decades .
People can know their friends ' recently looks and interesting things happens on that people just by checking their facebook or other social media sites .
Generally , the clinic or hospital will not tell the carrier 's families without the agreement of carrier .
More people ( relatives ) know her problem , more information channel is provided .
This skill requires practices and can not be done completely through social media .
People can think while typing and prepare what they want to say but in face-to-face communication , every word that comes out of your mouth and may be not well arranged is the picture of your personality .
First of all , from the angle of human right , a genetic risk carrier should not be obligated to tell the truth to others .
Whether we are at home or at school , at work or on a holiday , we are able to communicate and interact with our friends .
It is almost imposible for us to keep way from it .
For example , in 2012 general election is Singapore , Dr Tan Chee Keong made use of facebook to spread his campaign videos to the public .
Depending on whom the genetic risk was discovered from : the son or daughter for example , the parents who knows about this would decide who gets told and whom takes the precedence in being 'allowed ' to tell .
In real life , we communicate with one another as equal participants .
Thus I believe that social media sites are one of useful tool to help people known each other better .
It provides people with more convenient contact environment and improve the frequency of meeting with each others .
Social media sites ' role in connecting people around the world is undeniable .
This means that the students are not concetrating when they supposed to do so .
However , I believe that the benefits brought by these online chatting rooms tremendously outweigh their repercussions .
Undeniable , it becomes more addicting when we spend more time busy socialising and interacting virtually .
Once the test is done , whether the results should be open to his or her relatives has caused social extensive controversy .
Whereas , it can also make people forget to communicate to their family and friends in the real life and affect negatively to their interpersonal skills .
Furthermore , the convenience of social media is also its weakness .
The cyber communication is quite different to face to face communication and people who depends on cyber communication too much will not get used to the real life communication .
Some will wish to keep it to themselves and hope to ensure that they will not bring in any pessimism into their family .
In this case , the social network helps people to increase the frequency of talk .
We broadcast these facades of us to others .

Since the technology of modern society has been so advanced , it becomes possible for people to make decision to take genetic test so as to be clear whether or not they carry genetic risk which can affect their next generation .
Many advantages are given to the users .
However , once a test has been conducted and the results are known , a family-related ethical dilemma is born .
First , for the case of marrige , people should be honest and tell his/her spouce they may carry certain genetic risk that may affect their offsprings .
This kind of behaviour is not good to people 's psychological health according to a research .
There are really a lot of things we need to consider .
The first one is the importance of being responsible for your self-wellness and health of your relatives and the second one is being responsible for the next generations .
For more convenience , sentences are shortened to simply three or four words such as lol ( which means laugh intensively ) and " asap " ( which means as soon as possible ) .
If used for a good purpose , it can prevent unnecessary unhappiness , however , it could also make situation worse by revealing who the carrier is , in the family .
This is due to people spending comparatively more time on social networking than time on reading newpapers .
If anything wrong happened to the carrier 's life , without informing the family members it could make a huge regret in their life if she leaves without them knowing about it .
In a nutshell , a carrier of a known genetic risk should have their own right to decide whether to tell their relatives or not .
These are some concrete examples of how the socia media reduce face-to-face human contact .
The last but not the least , with all kinds of personal information on one 's social network page , it is covenient for criminal to make use of this information to commit a crime .
For example , on mother 's day , people are shy to say " I love you " to their mothers so they can type it on his or her mother 's facebook page .
Therefore , with the help of technology , people are able to catch up wth each other conveniently .
Focus on the negative side of the annouance of genetic risk first .
Some said that the genetic risk that is found in a person should be kept secret because it is considered as a personal information which should be kept confidential .
Several arguments have been made regarding the social media actually have some inevitable disadvantages to people .
If we tell them , they may start paying more attention to their daily habits like eating less sugar contained food and keeping a good mood .
We ca n't make a law to push a carrier of a known genetic risk to tell his or her relatives about his genetic problem .
Despite one may argue that it 's still up to the individual to disclose such health issue or to bear it within him/herself , it 's certainly helpful to share with close relatives , for a proper discussion for solutions .
Therefore I think a know genetic risk should not be obligated to tell his or her family or relatives .
However , some people may argue that why we want to interfere with their lives ?
Particularly , in the medical field , there is a great improvement in many treatments for many formally incurable diseases , and genetic testing is one of the methods which were used to diagnose an individual at risk for a genetic disorder .
People with close blood relationship generally carry some similar genes .
As the techonology has been advancing , it has reached a stage whereby the advancement triggers some ethical dilemmas in relation to the acutual use of the techonology .
It is also entire incorrect to fault social media alone for the lack of interpersonal skill .
And I am able to easily find a common topic when I contact them .
In the sophisticated era like these days , experts keep producing inventions that are meant to make life easier .
In conclusion , a carrier of a known genetic risk is encouraged to tell his or her relatives about the known genetic risk .
They should let their spouse know about his or her situation before marriage .
However , there exits some disadvantages which will affect people in some degree .
Also , they will not have enough experience to communicate with people in face and not be trained in their conversation skills .
Thirdly , a lot of updating of luxury living standard as well as other show-off situations may make people 's daily life more and more grandiloquent , which is not an accurate social growing trend .
This would avoid the rise of more family-related ethical dilemma .
This is reasonable since the exposure of the truth of being a carrier may make them be discriminated or sympothized by others which is not positive factors brought to their life .
However , they can avoid the disease genes being inhered to their children .
However , not everybody is so lucky that they can make sure they do not carry any disease genes .
For example , in 2012 , there were false rumors of fires , shootouts , and caravans of gunmen in a Mexico City suburb which had spread through Twitter and Facebook .
However , as I said earlier , it is better for the person to at least tell about the potential risk to his or her future partner since his genetic risk may affect his children later .
But , if there is trust and mutual understand on social media , it will be ideal for people to improve relationship and make new friends .
Social network plays a role in providing and also filtering information .
Though social media do create relationships , relationships and friendships are only firm and real if people have gone through experiences and communication in face-to-face interaction .
Without facebook , we may lost contact .
With the sharing of personal photos , posting of status of one 's personal feeling or experience and able to reply to these posts allowed human interaction to be engage and expand with ease .
As time passed , we may have more " friends " on the list , but the meaning of friends needs to be redefined .
Not only the phone did the jobs for them , but also devices like personal computer , laptop , tablet , and many other devices which are able to connect to internet .
On top of that , as the genetic risk may pass down to next generation , thus it will involve more than just one family .
Otherwise , if the other parties did not know , they may end up with to have diabete in the future without any prevention .
To prevent that from happening , I do feel that it is up to the person whether he wants to share the information with his family since his family may either be paranoid or judge him and act differently .
Social media does have some other advantages beside their general benefits to human being .
Many people like to use language to pretend themselves , and lost confidence when they talk to each other .
As the result , it is in the interests of the carriers and their relatives , telling the genetic testing result is needed .
Then the relatives can prepare themselves to prevent the disease to occur .
Firstly , I believe most of us will agree with the sentences below : " I will be anxious about my families when he or she told me that he or she was a carrier of a known genetic risk " .
When we were born , we were surrounded by our family and relatives , with them welcoming us to this new world .
Social media sites such as Facebook has allow us to share our pictures or even chat online with our parents while we are overseas .
Nowadays , even some companies conduct online video interview with their applicants as it saves time and cost .
Therefore , people may not contact with the faraway friends and relatives unless there are something important .
That is because we are acting who we are in reality while we have no reason to do that in the online virtual world .
Besides , there are more people shwing their pictures of yummy food or travelling experience .
It can take a few days or weeks for those to receive the messages .
Using a common social media site with my friends to help me know what are their statuses nowadays .
In my opinion , social media websides such as Twitter and Facebook will not affect the chance for people to have face to face contact and thus negatively affects interpersonal skills .
social games ) which allow users to communicate with remote people , and also to update and express themselves at the same time .
For the countries like Singapore , they are short of manpower to contribute to the nation .
In those diseases , many who are affected do actually have different physical characteristics compared to those without the genetic diseases .
To them , social media is the only resource they can approach to know everything happened in their home country and the way they can use to show their lives to their lovers as well .
Life is hard but people can not blame it on being unfair .
From a practitioner 's perspective these findings are important because if lay constructs of the family and kinship are a social construct they may not be in line with geneticists ' views of family relationships , or about which blood ( or non-blood ) relatives should be informed and by whom ; this is also likely to be dependent on the cultural and ethnic context .
Secondly , it helps people to keep in-touch with one another .
Without trust and love , there is no difference between a family and a bunch of strangers living together .
In addition , cyber relationship can not always work in real life .
Even when people are thousands of miles apart , social media make it possible to have interaction by keep writing comments .
"
Many people feel that we should tell our relatives since we really care about their health status .
But there is possibility that the person on the other side is deceiving you in order to obtain your information against you .
Furthermore , since it is the person 's gene that is affected , he has the right to determine with whom he wants to share the information with .
I do think there is difference in it and I believe many of us will agree .
And at the same time , improves the interpersonal skill , through dynamic practises betwwen individuals and realtime presence .
Therefore , for an effective and efficient society , there is a need to have a balance of both social media interaction and face-to-face human interaction within its people .
They were told that the wife 's family was carrying the polygenetic disorder and can pass only to boys rather than girls .
Pepope do not know how to talk with others face to face , especially the strangers .
It will make him or her quite upset when they communicate in real life .
This is because by the ease of technology such as airplane , some of our friends might be going overseas to continue their studies or even you are away from your family to pursue your studies or even careers in life .
In addition , it is impractical to make such a law .
It might not be able to replace the joy that you have when you are with your family but it could help to reduce the sadness of being away from your family .
It started withthe invention of technology which has evolved tremendously over the past few decades .
Hence , with the knowledge of having genetic risk , the relatives of this genetic disease will do a medical check-up , which might save them in realising it at a earlier stage .
And so , he would have chosen not to undergo generic disorder testing and let the truth be mined forever .
This is not the case I am talking about here .
Therefore , this kind of circumstances will not be happened again and again .
The parents are now the " friends " of their kids , and they can now " follow " their kids more closely and on real time .
People can contact their friends on the internet and get their reply very fast .
If they spend too much time on these social media , it may cause some problems to their mental development .
Facebook is like a combination of message and chatting service , personal profile , media of sharing , and other entertainment add-on ( i.e .
I agree with this statement to a large extent .
Without hanging out with friends or talking with friends through phone , we can know his of her latest news by scaning the webpage .
Apart from the ease of communication despite of the distance , many other advantages such as knowledge sharing and trades can be done through social media as well .
The reason behind is that after WOWII the population of China decreased dramatically and so the government encourage the people to give more birth .
Teenagers may believe these people and easily be cheat and lose money even their safe .
If the genetic risk carrier is a minor or a child , then most likely the decision of informing the relative should be made with the consideration of the patients parents or legal guardian .
Socia media allows them to explain to or inform people what is going on .
The danger of such media socialisation is the uncertainty of such communication due to lack of physical interaction .
Once one person in the family is found to be carrying risky genetic , other members in his or her family may also have the risk of disease .
Here I want to share Forest'view on this issue .
In addition , some may think that even knowing about having genetic risk of the disease , it will just adding on to their misery as there is nothing that they can do about it .
This is related to the interpersonal skill that is mentioned before , that can be decreasing qualitatively if we are used to facing gadget , not facing human being .
In comparison , in the field of genetic testing which enables people to be aware of the risk of a possible genetic disorder , as the technology has been very mature already , an even more popular topic arises .
If they do not want to think too much of it and view it as a trouble , they may just ignore the possibility .
One of the diseases is sickle cell trait .
This is not the parent 's fault because there is still chances of the gene being inherited .
Last but not least , though genetic testing is a personal matter , telling the result to your family can improve and develop understanding and sympathy of each other as well as promoting awareness of taking care of everyone 's health .
The awareness of your relatives and families about your genetic risk is good for your self-wellness and health of your relatives .
A person with a disorder , regardless of mental or physical disorder , is always easy to be awared by his or her families .
If phone and letter are the only way to contact them , we would probably not able to find them .
People and friends often mock of your conditions .
This is especially to people who are overseas .
Have you ever wondered why we use these tools to connect ourselves with other people ?
Genetic risk refers more to your chance of inheriting a disorder or disease .
However , there is a role and a sense of responsibility to inform their relatives since it is a genetic disorder .
He can even talk to her daughter face-to-face using video call via internet .
Therefore , the social media truly limit the interpersonal skills such that people lose the chance and the ability to practice talking and connect the relation between him and their friends .
The carrier should be honest with his or her feeling and I find that it is the right of the family member to know what is going on to his or her life .
Most patients will be depressed after realising his or her conditions .
They may not able to enjoy a normal people can enjoy .
Once you suffer from cancer , the medication cost is very expensive .
Another disadvantage that affects other people is that by only showing selected part of our lives , we build " false image " in public .
The most popular information get circulated the most so I can seldom miss it .
Moreover , telling their family members the truth is the fastest and easiest way to get their support .
On the other hand , others may think that it will be considerate to tell the relatives because the latter will have a higher tendency of getting the same genetic risk .
Thirdly , social media sites keep us up-to-date on latest news and updates from almost everywhere in the world , all with a click away on the refresh button .
Then nobody wants to marry A , or his relatives .
Genetic testing has become a beneficial way to predict and protect each individual at risk for a disorder .
Distance and time are no longer the problems , which is convenient especially when instant chat is needed .
Writing is an essential skill of person who express their own feelings and opinions .
However , if you tell the truth to your wife and relatives , you offer a chance about whether to have child or not .
So , they have to also prepare mentally .
It is our responsibility to identify the advantages and disadvantages of social media sites .
It is a method that benefits two parties which is a win-win situation .
When people around us know that we got certain disease , their altitudes will be easily changed , whether caring us too much or keeping away from us .
Therefore there is nothing to be shy for or be afraid of .
Besides that , these skills requires time to develop and adapted .
Only by absorbing the essence and discarding the dregs can we make better use of the social media .
On the other hand , it may even increase the chance of having face to face contacts amoung people .
For example , on Twitter , it is exciting to follow people that you adore like famous movie and series stars , business men and entrepreneurs .
One can not truly show their emotions by another by texting some = ) signs .
Think in another way , if we put those time we spend on wandering on those sites , we may already finish one book or do other more meaningful things .
Since ancient times , human interact with others face by face .
With the improvements of technology , a new life with genetic risk can be detected .
They will feel it becomes difficult for them to find any topics to communicate with other people .
Unlike today , with the help with social media , people can easily get the information they want just by searching on line , and know about what that person did everyday at what time .
With the welcoming of application such as Skype and Facetime , any individual can phase off most , of the olden days communication methods .
Therefore my Manager would not miss the moments of her daughter 's growth .
As it is a genetic risk,the patient next-of-skin might have a high chance of carrying the risk,hence the need to inform their relatives is important so that necessary prevention actions could be taken before unforeseen circumstances might occur.For example,if you are the only child in a family and unfortunately,you are suffering from a genetic disease that the genetic trait might be passed on to your next generation if you have a child,hence by letting your family members aware of the situation,it would lessen family stresses and suffering on forcing you to settle down and have children.However , social ethic issues like discrimination and privacy are biggest concerns and potential barriers to enforce patients or doctors to disclose information to patients relatives.It challenges the confidentiality and privacy principles.Currently , under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 ( HIPAA ) in the United States,there is no legal obligation requirement to disclose information to relatives,it is up to the patient 's wish to disclose to their family members.Early disclosement to family members brings in positive reaction and prevention,as in the case of Angelina Jolie,she chose to disclose information and underwent treatment to reduce the risk of breast cancer significantly to under five percent.I still can recall her reason for disclosing her own story was that she does not want to live under the shadow of cancer .
No pledge of authenticity risks people 's information and privacy that are shared on social media sites .
" This issue has been discussed for a long time .
We can not deny that the genetic testing really helps people a lot when they face the disorder problem .
Many people in our society are not well informed about many genetic diseases and many of them will most likely to judge or at least differentiate those who have genetic diseases since they feel that the patients are abnormal or 'weird' .
Not only that , new friends can be easily met through such online platforms .
There are more intangible advantages that could support the stand of informing the relatives once the results are known after the test conducted .
Hence , for a family in which every member is truly believing in each other and loving each other ,all these troubles are just testaments to make them stronger .
If the person tell their relatives that he or she carries a disease gene , his or her relatives can go to hospital to check whether they also get a disease gene .
However , after one has registered in those social media sites which are not reliable , all the information you have filled in will be a weapon against you in the future .
As we graduate from a school , we will probably lose contact with some of our friends .
People used to write letters and send post cards to keep in touch with ones live far away from them in the past .
A father may be able to make a call to his daughter who is in other country via socia media software instead of making international call which costs a lot to normal salary family .
Personally I feel more at ease on social medias .
With the frequent usage and reliance of the social media and the Internet , a society that socialises through the cyber will be more advance and adapted to the highly connected world .
Not long ago , the human genome project sponsored by several large multinational corporations ( MNCs ) has been started .
Nevertheless,everything in life has positive and negative effects .
In this particular case , we are discussing about whether a person should tell his relatives about him having a RISK of a particular genetic disease .
Unlike people with high proportion of skin pigment , people with albinism is prone to sunburn and other skin diseases .
Although emocons can be used to show certain emotion , this differs from the real authentic emotion of your friends when you observed them through their body language and their facial expression .
But overall , the advantages far outweigh its disadvantage .
Parents know what the best is for their children , thus they will make a right decision after they have be informed .
Social media is only beneficial as long as we know how to use it in a correct and suitable way with the combination of both social media sites and daily life interaction to develop people 's potentials to the fullest .
In less than a week half of the town knows person A has a risked gene , and his family might be a genetically risked family .
The advancement of those social media sites makes people so rely on them that some of them rather prefer using those sites to contact each other than talking to each other face to face .
A Carrier of a Known Genetic Risk Should be Obligated to Tell His or Her Relatives
One should have the full control of his/her information and it is his/her right to decide whether or not to disclose it to some one else .
This subsequently leads to the poor interpersonal skills that inhibit the growth of our real social circle .
Spouses usually have very close relationships , if person A tell his family that he has this gene , his uncle C knows and tells his wife D that he needed to run a test because his cousine has this disease .
Twitter , Facebook and Skype are some social media sites which enable us to keep in touch with our friends or family who are in other cities or countries .
However , is it the same when we keep in touch with someone virtually compared to when we meet them personally ?
Although it looks like no laws and it is your own space to speak and do anything you want , you are actually wrong .
Taking Angeline Jolie for example , she is famous but she still revealed the truth about her genetic testing on the development of her breast cancer risk .
Firstly , someone having what kinds of disease belongs to his or her privacy .
Firstly , social media brings convenience to the world .
Their son unfortunately fell ill and he was diagnosis a kind of genetic disease which is very serious .
Nevertheless , they still can use phone to do normal call and message to contact .
They always have a choice about whether to undergo the genetic test or not .
What we can do is to educate the public about the importance of their friends just by their side and teach them to manage their time well .
By telling their relatives that they may have a risk of carrying the disease gene can make their family members bond closely , also many risks and conflicts can be avoided .
As a result , if the situation keep go on in this unexpected trend , it will cause a bad effect on the young generation .
It is better for both parties to be honest .
In this case , I have to say that to err is human .
As I mentioned in the beginning , there is also disadvantages of social media tools .
There is no need to for people to go out of their home to interact with others , they chat online , share pictures , tell others what they have done or funny stories .
Social media also provides people huge brunch information about people and things that they interests .
Parents and relatives have to work longer than expected and endlessly to foster their child if he/she is not able to foster himself/herself .
Besides that , the risk of the known genetic is very serious that it can not be described .
As people feel more confident online where they do not have to face in real-life on the spot , they feel more comfortable and thus prefer communicating online .
By doing so , one will feel less stressful in facing such disorder risk .
Some family may feel hurt , with regards to their family pride or reputation , on having the knowledge of such genetic disorder running in their family .
Once people 's genetic information is told to other people .
If the disorder symptoms reflect on a kid , the parent will be informed by the medics for sure , then the whole family will stay alert to their bodies ' condition .
The earlier we tell them , a better habit they will arise and better for the rest of their lives .
Finding old friends through Facebook , for example , is more easier than asking people around in real life .
Furthermore , not everyone on the social media sites is honest .
People can not avoid carrying the disease genes , which they born with .
However , its disadvantages also can not be ingnored when you cosider it as a platform to show off and a stage for cyber crime .
Therefore , the social media is truly good for people .
However , many of the carriers are not strong enough to overcome the challenges oneself .
In certain aspects , social media has brought us quite a lot of convenience .
The notion of authority also extended 'vertically' .
In conclusion , the use of social media has more advantages than disadvantages to our daily lifes .
Hence it lessens valuable interaction between human and time we spend away from the computer screen or mobile phone .
Genectic testing is a personal decision , with the kowledge that there is a possiblity that one could be a carrier or not .
In conclusion , social media in the contemporary society is able to help one improve relationship and make new friends , as well as , disseminate information efficiently to the masses .
Although it helps to connect us with our friends wherever we are , it at the same time reduces the chance for us to talk to our friends face to face which may affect our interpersonal skills .
For example , we tend send a birthday wishes when Facebook promts us " Today is someone 's birthday " .
Among all kinds of different diseases , a large amount of different kinds of disorders are caused by genetic reasons .
It will be hard for an individual to deal with the issue on its own .
One of the reasons why is because as a carrier , she or he needs a mental support to go through with this situation .
But , there will still be unreliable sources spreading false information on social media sites despite high security to control almost every social networking movement .
Some of the famous examples would be social media sites like Twitter and Facebook .
This is their human right to know about that , and this may also save their lives by preventing the disorder to happen .
The answer is simply that everyone , especially our family , has the right to know the truth .
This might be beneficial for his future if he is aware of the risk of having this disorder .
The disadvantages of social network media are quite undeniable .
This is a potential danger for teenagers who are growing with social changes to get hurt .
We can not let it go .
There are many people in the social media with beautiful image and good content in their pages , however in real life , he or she may do not have jobs or live poorly .
Again , there is a trend for them to suffer from social media addition and their study and work may be greatly influenced .
Gone were the times , and now we do mass sending and the receiver may feel less meaning in such online wishes .
For example , if a carrier is told that he/she has the risk to have diabetes .
It is a concern that will be with us during our whole life , because we will never know when the ''potential bomb' ' will explode .
The convenience is beyond description .
He runs a test and know that he has the gene AA .
There also exists some probability of wrong testing .
We discuss every thing we like and we have more personal space.Our friends also got more access to know what we are doing and what we like .
More and more illness are discovered to be related to some genes with the development of the medical technology .
People do not have the ability to choose their gene , they should not be thought badly because of bad gene .
However , the social media sites truly reduce the communication in face-to-face which truly affects interpersonal skills .
Other than that , I believe that the stong bond we have with our family is the biggest pillar of support to the carrier .
This competitive world is cruel to those are not able to survive .
So I think whatever the genetic is or whether the gene is match with their parents , it should not be told to anyone even his or her family or relatives .
However , there may be some special case that is hard to be defined .
However , thanks to facebook , I can still keep in touch with them and I know what they are doing recently as we living close to each other .
Furthermore the act of informing others without the consent from their parents or the patients itself could harm the psychological state of the affected family .
With more convinient and humanian communications , the relationship between government and people get largely improved .
With current booming technology , it is agreeable that people become more technology-savvy and they want to spend more time interacting with each others through social media sites , however , it does not mean that we should neglect face-to-face human interaction as it plays even a more important aspect in our life .
To sum up , social media has advantages and disadvantages in people 's daily life .
Indeed , I myself use Facebook just because of the friends ' contacts that I want to keep .
Secondly , people makes friends all over the world and able to update their friends his recent activity easily .
It also brings many negative effects such as loss of face-to-face communicating skills which is important in their working place .
It shortens the distance between people from all over the world and makes instant communication possible .
However , if you have undergone and known that you are a carrier , you are responsible for your whole family .
Regardlessly , if the disorder is rarely to be fatal , or it does not caused any inconvenience to the carrier , revealing the truth is always the right thing to do .
Thus , advice from hospital plays the important role for this .
Hence , social media has benefited the masses by equipping them with a powerful tool to disseminate information almost immediate to the people around them .
This piece of information does play a role in family planning matters , therefore although no one is obliged to tell about their genetic risk to anyone , it should be encouraged to tell it to their future partner .
Because if you are carrying that genetic risk , then there is great possibility that your relatives like parents or siblings are carrying the same genetic risk as well .
With regard to this choice given , there must be some rules to regulate and exercise personal freedom of decision making .
The types of use must also be taken note of - informing , interacting , discussion and others .
Therefore , to keep the information as secret to his/her future spouce would help the relationship .
Through Facebook , peope are able to maintain relationship with their old acquaintances .
The communication is also not limited in words .
More importantly , it is cheap and easy to use social media .
The certainty of what is being shared or expressed could not be proven physically as media limits this physical interaction , except when using a webcam to chat .
In the past , people used to writing letters to their friends and it will take relatively long time to send the letter over .
The advantages and disadvantages of using such social media in the society are elaborated on as follows .
As for those in your family who are more likely to be affected , they can go to the hospital to do the checks regularly .
Therefore , telling the families and the relatives to get prepared for fighting the disease and even prevent to get the disease is your responsibility .
This approaches help the parents to communicate with their children and know what kind of activities that their children have when they are overseas .
On the other hand , the viewers , are not the listeners .
While millions of users are connect at any one time , any information can be readily available at their perusal .
The son was died after one year 's treatment and the couple got divorced later after that .
As a result , they will lose eyes to contact and hands to express their feeling to people nearby them , which means they have lost the tools they need for face-to-face contact communicating .
In addition , doctors usually quote a statement , " Prevention is better than curation " ; this gives us an idea that preventing a disorder to happen has far more advantages than curing it .
With the advancement of technology in recent years , the need to keep in-touch with people and latest news has become a tremendous demand .
The people with albinism have sensitive skin and it needs regular treatment .
Some may even do something wrong .
By doing this ,they may be able to save some lives of their relatives .
A strong mental condition and conviction must be build from within and from the closest ones .
A good law should be clear and easy to execute .
Hence , there were also tensions if participants felt that they could neither pass on information to relatives who needed to know ( such as nieces and nephews ) nor persuade those with authority ( the parents ) to do so .
Thus , long distance relationship or friendship can be maintain and keeping in touch with your circle of friends has been made much easier .
If they do not even know that they are at risk for a genetic disorder , how can this explain their right ?
It is just different .
Instead , all of them were more interested in posting pictures of this " cheerful " meeting on their social media sites .
Privicy protection belongs to one 's human rights .
As a part of this modern society , we should learn to distinguish between good and bad impacts brought by the advancement of technologies , and also learn to avoid the cons and maximize the benefits of those sites .
And if you are not on it , you will just get lost .
In the end , I believe that the support in terms of mental or even monetary from your family could help the carrier to fight against the genetic disease .
If the relatives carry that disease gene , they can share the experience with him or her and give some help , they will also teach him or her how to communicate with others about this issue .
Everything is not that bad if you know how to look at the bright side with hope .
Carrier is responsible to balance his or her own interest and the benefits of family and even society .
Afterward , the carrier will face a serious ethical issue , which is to reveal the problem to his or her relatives or not .
On the other hand , it may pass the disease to the next generation if the carrier hides the truth .
Within clicks , we could check on the friend 's profile and read on for his/her updates .
It is obvious to see that internet saves people 's time and also connect people globally .
Nevertheless , there are cyber polices who roam around these social networking platforms to prevent these hoaxes spreading around .
We all know that life is priceless and we have no right to judge a person 's death .
These social media serves a purpose to bind people in spite of their geographical boundaries but it does n't mean that surrounding people are neglected as the payoff .
With an increasing users of more than billion users from all over the world , social media sites have demonstrated clearly its success in playing an important part of our life .
While we do know that we should not discriminate them based on their limitations , many people still do it with or without them realizing it .
They can become anyone .
Consider a case , we decide to undergo genetic testing and have known the result of it .
In a nutshell , every sword has two edges .
However , there rises a family-related ethical dilemma if it is right to tell a carrier 's family once the test has been conducted and the results are known .
Social media provides people a way of talking and chatting which can never be considered as a way of communication .
However , social media site is a double-sided sword , it also bring in some negative effect on our daily life .
However for some rare diseases , people who have certain gene changes are guaranteed to develop the disease .
Through the social media sites , we can chat with our friends who stay in Europe and New Zealand .
If you have n't undergone the genetic testing , it 's just odd and fate for what will happen to both of you and your relatives .
He or she has the right not to tell anyone .
However,there are still people against the decision of revealing private information.As in the case of Alzheimer patients,it is up to the patient 's own choice to disclose information.However,research has shown that doctors have tried to interpret who,how and whom will Alzheimer disease be disclosed to minimise potential negative impact to families members ( DementiaToday,2012 ) .There are associations provide helps to Alzheimer patients like Alzheimer 's Association ( Alzheimer 's Association,1980 ) .Although there are still thousand of genetic risk diseases out there that might not be receiving all helps and supports from everyone,the needs to receive immediate understanding and support from family members is an utmost help that patients need in their difficult time .
We tend to post pictures with the best looks , status that are funny .
In fact , requiring someone to communicate his or her own genetic risk to family members who are therefore also at risk is considered by many to be ethically dubious .
Many people many argue that setting the obligation may help more people , who are the relatives of the carriers , save their lives with a larger opportunity because of the early diagnosis .
The idea of searching for democracy is passed from Egyptians to people in Zambia quickly through the use of social media .
Therefore , I thought a known genetic risk should not be obligated to tell his or her family or relatives .
A lot of fresh graduates can find jobs thanks to Facebook and Twitter .
The sharing of information can be done faster through social media as well , that is why nowadays many news publishers make their own social media account , for example Channel News Asia has a twitter account and will update its follower with headline news .
Overall , there are more benefits than the costs .
On the other side , as stated above , a person who want to confirm and has been prepared to face the result can choose to do the genetic testing individually .
The law 's spirit also include the fairness .
Though it is said that genetic testing involves emotional and social risks due to the test results , while the potential negative impacts of the risk still exist , the consequence will be significant if other members of his or her family do not know .
Firstly of all , social media can make it more convenient for people to make friends and contact each other .
This type of communication does not help forging interpersonal relationships .
If a gene runs in the family , one of the family member test positive , whom does he need to tell .
He has to choose whether to protect his family or make his family more prosperity with a potential generic risk .
It may be awkward and embarrassed for a person to tell relatives that he or she is a carrier of a known genetic risk .
We may in actual fact communicating with a hoax Facebook acccount of a cyber friend , which we assume to be real but in reality , it is a fake account .
Also they can prevent the disease going to their offspring .
However , when people become more and more addicted to this convenience and fail to communicate with people who are close to them , their face-to-face interpersonal skills are lost .
We communicate with others using social media , such as twitter , facebook and microblog more and more frequently .
If the knowledge of the genetic risk was to be shared within the family or relatives , there might have chances for them to have it in their blood , which they may do necessary precautions to prevent .
Frequently , the intention of the carriers does not want to tell their families are to continue their own life without the anxious of families .
The debatable question , an ethical dilemma , is that are people responsible for telling their relatives that they carry a known genetic risk ?
Instead , we will post a seed and tag our friends to inform this kind of changments .
The question given is whether a carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to tell his or her relatives and I think that the carrier should not be obligated to do so because I belive that he or she has right not to know .
However , this is not exactly true when other factors including psychological influence , social influence , are taken into consideration .
There are advantages and disadvantages in this change .
As the consequence , it affects their interpersonal skills .
But seriously , most people only post the happiest moments in their lives .
In retrospect , its is also ones duty to ensure that he or she undergo periodic healthchecks in their own .
First and foremost , all social media sites are free .
In this case , if one of the family members or close relatives is found to carry genetic risk , it is better for the patient to tell his/her close relatives about the issue and let others known about the risk so that his/her familay members are able to perform some daily excesses to prevent the potential disease or they may go to hospital and check for the correspongding flows .
However , it seems that , especially for some those , sharing some parts of their lives such as videos and photos on the social media sites become really necessary .
Just as the lyrics of Kelly Clarkson , what does n't kill you make you stronger .
The social network may also creat some negative impacts for the people .
If he or her not get married , he or she must tell his or her partner that he carries disease gene .
In my opinion , the carrier should tell his or her relatives about it .
The spreading of false information can be a potential psychological threat to everyone , given that social media can disseminate information in a realtively fast speed .
People can express themselves through pictures or emotions .
Genetic testing will be conducted when the individual is at risk of some possible disease .
On contrary , if the carrier is an adult , who has his own choice to choose whether to inform his or her relatives about the risk , that will be more complex .
And if you still decide to have the baby , since the technology has been developed so advanced , it might be possible in the future that the application of altering gene is perfected and widely used , you can then choose to give birth to babies by giving them a brighter future .
Maybe after we tell them , they will go for it and know more about themselves .
On the other hand , if there are ways can help us to control or cure the disease , we can going through thses process from the scope of the whole family .
This is an issue need to be addressed as family-related ethical dilemma is involved .
However , it also raised the concerns about whether it brings us more benefits or a human disaster .
For example , does the carrier only need to tell his or her direct relatives like parents and brothers and sisters or does he also need to tell relatives like his grandmother 's sister 's son 's daughter 's nephew ?
These social media may be tools of their campaign and manipulating the thoughts of the public .
However , if a dignosed carrier is obligated to tell his or her relatives , the relatives will be forced to know their higher chance of being genetic risk carriers .
Thus , having the knowledge that such genetic disorder is benign would be beneficial towards their emotinal thoughts .
Also , telling them the result can let them largely reduce the cost for multiple testing .
Albinism is one of the examples .
People can also know much information about the celebrity in Twitter and Facebook such as Obama , Bill Gates and get the first-hand study materials on it .
Communication would have took a different turn without the easily available social media .
In conclusion , in order to avoid the family-related ethical dilemma , it is best for any carrier of known genetic risk to inform his/her relatives .
The relationship between the parents and their children should not be tested only in the genetic way ; it is something much deeper and tighter .
However , I believe it is just a usual reaction to this situation .

There might be a possibility that the genetic disorder could also affect their relatives and any other families within the same family tree .
There are two advantages and two disadvantages of using the social media in people 's daily life .
One might also choose to hint or encourage their certain relatives to run a gene test if they are concerned about negative consequences that comes across when they disclose their genetic results .
The children rely the parent to live .

People who aware of having such disorder can prevent the disorder to happen by adapting a healthy lifestyle , including having a balanced diet and at least having exercise for 30 minutes every day .
Genetic testing has been made possible- it has become easy to tell if one is a carrier of a known genetic risk through genetic testing .

It is an obligation for a carrier to inform his relatives , but also an obligation for a family member to liven up the family .
However , there is news about the social media sites leaks users ' information to companies with cash reimbursement .
Therefore , telling the relatives about the situation may avoid a lot of trouble in this way and save much time for proper treatment .
Since we can see both advantages and disadvantages of using social media , and we can not deny the huge benefits that have been brought to us , this main trend of using social media may be still lasting for a long time .

The Impact Of Social Media

When we use facebook and post pictures and statuses .

Many people says they will support the social media since it really helps them to have a closer view about how their friends are going in other parts of the world .
In conclusion , a carrier of a known genetic risk should not be obligated to tell his or her relatives .
Therefore , there is need to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of social media .
People who are not good at public chatting may be more reluctant to talk to people , and their interpersonal skills can never be improved under this situation .
And it is important for those young people .
Nowadays , what people need to do is just typing in front of the computer in their own rooms .
People get certain disease because of genetic changes .
And in my opinion , this seems to be the main purpose of undergoing that genetic testing at the first place .
The users , soon , will realise that they do not need such social media sites to keep in contact with the their friends because , if they really need somebody , they will reach the friends no matter what .
How can they not tell their loved ones who they really are and get their loved ones in danger ?
Disadvantages : One of the main concerns of using social media platform to communicate is credibility .
People can also get to know their friends ' state and mood by looking at their posts on line .
With the nature that the results will be known once the tests are done , each individual that is diagnosed to be a genetic risk carrier face an ethical problem : They should warn their relatives about the risking of being the same genetic risk carrier .
The reason why it is so addictive is , that the more people get into the social media , they seek attention from their friends .
This information needs to be at least acknowledged by the other party before they make the decision to get married and have children .
Family members , as one the closest group of people from whom they can get comfort , is a crucial factor for them to successfully get over any possible troubles as a result of genetic disorder .
On one hand , we do not want this potential danger causing firghtenning affects in our families ' later lives .
Human has their own rights and privacy .
And we keep track of all family members health conditions .
It is obvious that there will be better for one person to be worried than many .
I believe that some of the carriers will choose to not reveal their disease to the family members as they do not want to make their family members worry and feel uncomfortable or even feel ostracized by them .
Last but not least , social media does affect human interpersonal skills when people increase the time on social sites and reject chances to expose to social daily life activities as well as interacting with people .
The issue on right to know or not to know is highly debatable although it is a genetic risk , one can not be entire sure because the genetic information could possibly result from the families of either parents - his maternal and paternal uncles , aunts or cousin .
They play the important role in our life which can not be substituted .
Secondly , it can avoid genetic disease passed to the next generation when they intend to have babies .
At that time , the woman known how much her husband loved her but she ruined her happiness .
With no close relationship in real life but only close cyber friends , one is more possibly to feel lonely because the physiological need of human beings is to feel the bond with others by our five senses .
With the regulation of government and relevant authorities , the virtual world would be a better world .
And actually lots of rescuing jobs are done with the help of social media like looking for people get lost and so on .
However , I thought that the genetic information is one person 's personal privacy which should be protected by the law .
The other advantage is that it is easier to know about others by social media .
The receipent,will then receive the information almost immediately depending on the quality of the network .
A family of four having dinners in a restaurant without any chatting , because their holding and looking at their display screen with one hand when the other hand is holding a fork .
As a result , in the case that when one of the members happen to feel uncomfortable or unnormal , he or she should aware that whether the disorder in his or her body is a genetic risk or not .
In my opinion , every individual has to take responsibility of their own lives by making a right decision .
With my social network account , I seldom read newspapers or go to news websites anymore ; because I can easily read them from the status of my friends .
Researches show that face-to-face meeting frequency among people that are addicted to social media sites has been decreasing .
They can also take immediate measures to reduce the possibility of having this disease .
Once we found we were carrying this genetic risk , it is better for us to tell our family members because they may carry it as well .
However , there is still a diversity of point of views among the people .
Nowadays , people can just easily put their renting information on their facebook account and wait for the response from others who are from different parts of the world which brings us a huge amount of convenience .
In addition , with all those " nice " guys around on the social network website , one may neglect people surrounding him or her but just communicate with friends on facebook .
Social network sites provides us many convenience .
There are advantages and disadvantages in using social media sites , however in this case striking balance between social media and lives is the most important thing to do .
Generally people need they eyes to look at the display screen of their phone or computer and fingers to manipulate the corresponding device .
In fact , we may have just forgotten our friend 's birthday .
Although not everyone is good at public relationship even without the existence of the social media sites , we can not deny that it do affect some people in their ability of interpersonal skills .
Interpersonal skills , like any other skills requires practice .
For example , breast cancer is a genetic disease and it can be cured if it is being realised in the early stage .
This will then could lead to stress as these students are not able to cope with their studies because they were distracted .
I personally think this ist he right purpose of going through the genetic testing , so that a family who can not afford to have a disabled kid do not have to give birth to their child and make the entire family suffer .
What 's more , various of cultures can be shown to us through social medias .
Nevertheless , while I fell that a carrier should not be obligated to tell his or her relatives about the genetic risk , I would like to suggest the person to at least share the information with her or his potential partner ( husband or wife ) since the individual 's genetic risk may affect their future children .
They can even make new friends over similar interests on these platforms , which will be able to connect almost everyone closely in many parts of the world .
With the huge amount of cost savings , this capital can be utilized in the other sectors which benefits company more and boost up the company 's profit .
In addition , a woman testing positive for BRCA1 would be expected to allow her brother or sister to disclose such information to a niece or nephew rather than do it herself , although this may be further complicated by an individual 's response to risk information as they not want to know .
With the aids of social media , people bonds globally , information flows rapidly , and human lives happily .
The more we care about facebook , the less time we will have to spend with our friends .
First of all , people saves money by using internet to contact other people and reading news .
Every choice we have made may have a huge impact on their whole life .
This lowers the experience of human ability to interact with one another which can adversely shape one 's behaviour .
This will lead to a bad inter-personal skill as well as a problem of trusts .
If I am interested in politics , I can just follow some politics newspapers or public figures .
The inclusion of intimate presence and relative touch could also bring a better rapport between those interacting .
On the contrary , social media makes people lose their ability to communicate effectively in their real lives and makes people risk exposing their privacy to those whose identity can not be verified on the social media sites .
For instance , John is informed by his doctor that he is at risk for a genetic disorder but he does not tell his sibling , James about this .
If a law requires someone to tell others ' his or her privacy especially when the one is not willing to do so .
One may think that if the carrier is a caring person who loves his or her family more than himself , there is no doubt that he or she will tell his or her family about the issue .
Therefore , social networks brings more and more connections between people and they may have a chance to chat with people they never known before , and this helps to develop the interpersonal skills as well .
Recent research has shown that the more people spend time on social media sites , the less they become ambitious .
Thus , the lack of face-to-face human contact through social media restricts actual interaction which can be stimulated through the media .
That is true and of course it is the obligation of a family member to protect and take care of the family .
As people spend more and more time on such social media sites , the importance of the face-to-face human contacts has decresed .
Then eventually , she discovered that eight people became one as he was using eight different identities to chat with her all the time .
If there is no problem , that will be wonderful .
However , there are many problems againt the execution of asking a carrier to tell his or her ralatives the cause of his or her diseases .
Large numbers of patients with the genetic risk would want to keep it as a secret as the genetic risk may indicates their high chance to carry certain disease .
In the past , vast communication are done by one of the many such a telegram , snail mail and poor-quality voice calls .
Compared to face-to-face interaction , online conversation is easier for strangers to open their mouth to each other .
Some people fake their identities in media sites so that they can know more people or some may even cheat others .
Social media is becoming more important and we need to think more to make it serve us better and better .
Social media helps to lessen the hassle of geographical distance and brings people closer .
Social media sites like Facebook and Twitter are born with the intention of connecting people , from around the world .
Unlike the use of social media , most of the interaction is done with thinking and typing .
Then they can have a healthy baby with the help of the doctors .
With the help of social media , I become real life friends with those from online forums whom I share the same interest with .
It also helps people to develop their interpersonal skills through online chating .
We should keep in mind that there are still ways for us to contact with our family or friends .
Today , social media sites , such as Facebook and Twitter , are relatively common within the contemporary society ; and , people can communicate with each other , online or offline , on these social networking platforms .
If the wrong testing was not found by the doctor , the family and the children may be sad and have a struggling life for their whole life .
Those who are born into a family with a history of genetic disease should be allowed to undergo genetic testing , even though if there is no risk at all .
Unlike just keeping contact numbers that we may not even call , social media like facebook is a great way for friends from different field or even from different parts of the world to be connected .
Many people are very brave in telling people about their opinions online but in real life some of them can be very shy and not outspoken at all .
Nowadays , thanks to the help of social media , with just one click , you can contact your family and friends wherever you want .
There are advantages and disadvantages in itself , however , whether it is good or bad we are still not sure .
Everything comes with benefits will also have their disadvantages .
No more worries about the time it takes to deliver letters and packages .
People should enjoy the advantages of social media while be aware of the disadvantages of that and try their best to avoid the disadvantages happen to them and their friends and family .
However , there are also some disadvantages occur due to the social media which are concerned in the society .
It is a hard decision to make but with the most appropriate way , it will create great circumstances for the carrier and families in the future .
After realizing the he or she is tshe carrier , the emotional damage would be hard to bear .
Therefore , the decision to inform relatives of such genetic disorder will be dependent of the situation and backgroung of the affected family , with the liberty of choice given to them in making the decision of informing others .
This kind of ethical issue can not be judged by the others because they will not understand the position and duty of the carrier in the family .
To the whole society , it is a duty .
It is because a carrier with bad gene may not necessary have those genetic disease , if they can have coresponding healthy lifestyle before the age that the gene 's function become stronger .
Since this will really affect their lives , what we should do is to try to make it in a positive way .
It is weird that people sit around the table but all face to their phones and do not talk with each other .
Think of the other way , if a child of the family knows that he has the risk to become a genetic risk carrier , and the risk might as well inherit to his child in the future , his whole life will be in a dilenma .
There are three reasons as follows .
While , once they are communicating with people in their face , expressing themselves appropriately become really a big problem .
When ones chat on those media sites , there is no eye connection , no emotion delivery and even the expressions are typed in by using some combinations of punctuations .
There are always newspaper report that a new born baby has be abandoned at hospital after they realized the baby have diseases that need a huge amount of money to secure .
In a conclusion , there are both advantages and disadvantages of using social media in daily life .
In a nutshell , our society ca n't push genetic problem carrier to tell his or her disease to his or her relatives but he or she should be willing to tell his or her relatives about his or her genetic problem .
During that period , if one of the family member reflects genetic disorder symptoms , he will fell in an ethical dilenma for sure .
More and more networking has been transferred to internet from real life .
As for the disadvantages of social media in our daily life , wasting time , causing illness related to sitting long time before the computer , quick-spread of rumor and fake news , most importantly , making people lost the ability to talk to others face to face confidently .
Imagine you are living like a normal person but suddenly one day your relative comes tells you that actually there are some possibilities that you may encounter some disease in the future , what kind of feeling are you going to have ?
People around the world could easily share their thoughts about their governments .
Thus , the new technology will be able to bring a prosperous future for our and next generation .
However , communication on social media is largely based on " broadcasting and listening " .
It makes people feel extreme close to their admirers ' lives and works .
The long distance and time-consuming make spreading the messages very difficult at that time .
The next two paragraphs will be discussing about the advantages and disadvantages of using social media in our society .
Young people can widen their relationships , meet new friends and learn wonderful things in many parts of the world .
Whose duty it is to inform at risk relatives or not greatly depends on the personal moral and the nature of how 'directive ' the risk is to them .
Furthermore , as it could incur spending a lots of money for the treatment , the carrier might not want to be the burden in her family .
Secondly , although social network takes time for people to chat online but not face to face , they may still decide a time online to meet others face to face in the daily life .
One of them is that it reduce the level of concentration especially among the youngsters .
Having support from relatives are vital as they ensure the genetic risk carrier that he/she is not alone in facing this illness and it will certainly provide a morale boost as the whole family will share a common sentiment with regards towards the future prospect of the genetic disorder which could be inherited by anyone in the family .
In conclusion , personally I feel that it is better for the carrier to inform her family members about the issue .
They pointed that actually social media reduces the chance for us to talk to people around us face to face .
Other people should not be told without the person 's permission even though they are his or her family or relatives .
First of all , it can be an alert for the family members of the patient and let them be aware of the possible disease that they may also have .
But , if it is a terminal disease as a genetic disease , most of the relatives will be disheartened upon having the knowledge about it .
This diagnosis can be regarded as a kind of privacy to carriers .
However , I belive that the carrier has right not to obligate to tell anyone but has responsibility to take an action to prevent any ethical dilemma .
If he chooses to live in the uncertainty that the gene holds and willing to accept it , he could do that , and it has been something that is 'normal ' to everyone in the past as gentic testing was not possible .
Firstly , interpersonal skills may be affacted by the reduction in face-to-face human contact .
Therefore an entirely new dilemma is born : should a carrier of a known genetic risk be obligated to tell his or her relatives ?
They may know the person 's potential disabled disease or other bad things naturally .
Without the facial impression , it is easier to misunderstand the intention of speakers .
In this fast pace and competitive world , people may not able to keep in touch with others .
People even prefer talk to their friends and meet their friends online and gradually reject face-to-face communication .
Without their concern and support , we are hard to stay until this time .
I agree that a carrier of a known genetic risk is obligated to tell his or her relatives .
By informing them , the carrier is never alone in fighting the battle of such disorder risk .
However , since internet were known , telephone started to give way to social media sites .
Sometimes a family with potential genetic disorder risk may not be able to detect the potential harm inside their bodies as none of their members reflect any observable disorder symptoms .
That plays an important role in the possibility that relatives can overcome the discrimination of the society and anxiety about the risks .
It could rather be better for him or her this way .
Next , communication are also greatly improved .
Admittedly , it is a social obligation to be responsible for the life of other people .
Their number of people that they know may only limited to the people they meet in daily life like classmates and working partners .
In corporate world , employers often block social media network to prevent employees to spend their office time on their personal leisure than concentrating on their work .
As the case of health issue is related to genetic risk , with keyword on " genetic " which highlights the risk of passing down the disorder to the next generation .
On the other hand , there are also problems with the population of the social media .
The child with genetic risk may not have the ability to work , to build up the family with the others and most of the time they are not acceptable for the majority .
So does social media network .
Genetic disorders are innate , but the great improvement of medical treatment makes it possible for humans to prevent the disorder or to reduce the negative effects of the disorder on themselves .
One can not truly understand a person with only stalking his/her facebook page where he/she carefully chooses what to present .
She talked with them every night , trust them and share her life with them .
Any individual at risk for a disorder has the right to undergo genetic testing , but whether the results should be informed to others , especially close family or relatives , is the topic that worth discussing .
Hence , it is undeniable that these sites play an important role in our global inter-connected world .
The social media is beneficial as it connect you and your loved one even though you are separated by the distance .
A known genetic risk can also affect our next generation critically .
The relation between parents and children is something about love and dedication .
For example , a grandmother may have more authority to pass on information than an aunt , even when she is not at genetic risk herself while the aunt is .
To the carrier himself of herself , he of she should have a feeling of resposiblity to tell his or her relatives their genetic disorder .
Social media has reshaped the way of communication .
