To put it in the nutshell , everything has its own pros and cons .
To the whole society , it is a duty .
Researches show that face-to-face meeting frequency among people that are addicted to social media sites has been decreasing .
To the carrier himself of herself , he of she should have a feeling of resposiblity to tell his or her relatives their genetic disorder .
If there is no problem , that will be wonderful .
Carrier is responsible to balance his or her own interest and the benefits of family and even society .
Today world is considered to be the era of social media sites like Facebook and Twitter which are attractively connecting people around the world .
It is not a heavy job for the family if they have prepare their mental first by disclosing the information of the probability that their children may suffer from the genetic disorder .
Surrounded by such concerns , it is very likely that we are distracted to worry about these problems .
Because of this , other people start to think that our lives are full of happiness with no problem at all .
People can also get to know their friends ' state and mood by looking at their posts on line .
Many people many argue that setting the obligation may help more people , who are the relatives of the carriers , save their lives with a larger opportunity because of the early diagnosis .
In fact , I strongly think that the carrier should weigh both the positive and negative consequences of taking the genetic testing and tak an appropriate action to the results .
Many people says they will support the social media since it really helps them to have a closer view about how their friends are going in other parts of the world .
They can learn how these people succeed and they can also have the chance to talk with them and know these famous persons ' thought by using the social media .
This allows friends that may not have the time for meet up to still connected in a way .
We all know that life is priceless and we have no right to judge a person 's death .
The obvious disadvantage of using social media is that the time reduction on face-to-face contact .
As a result , one does not train the necessarily parts of the skills required for a proper interpersonal relations .
His relatives can then take measures , if this disease can some how be prevented , to stop this disease from taking their lives .
In addition , the genetic risk carrier would be showered with moral and emotional support from their relatives if it is been made known to them .
However , if you tell the truth to your wife and relatives , you offer a chance about whether to have child or not .
In my opinion , the carrier should tell his or her relatives about it .
While we do know that we should not discriminate them based on their limitations , many people still do it with or without them realizing it .
Especially for the young people without marrige , if he/she is known to have some genetic risk , it may have certain chance that his/her child would carry the same disease , but not in certain .
This essay will discuss about the advantages and disadvantages of using social media in our daily life .
It is commonly seen in a food court or restaurant that a group of people sitting together around a table with each of them having a cell phone in their hands .
Secondly , social media network opens the door of opportunities for people due to its great benefit in connecting .
With the frequent usage and reliance of the social media and the Internet , a society that socialises through the cyber will be more advance and adapted to the highly connected world .
A typical example is genetic caused hypertension .
Therefore , I think a known genetic risk should not be obligated to tell his or her family or relatives without the person 's permission .
Therefore , the social media is truly good for people .
The other advantage is that it is easier to know about others by social media .
If you have n't undergone the genetic testing , it 's just odd and fate for what will happen to both of you and your relatives .
They need to ask for doctor 's advice before they plan to have a baby .
Therefore my Manager would not miss the moments of her daughter 's growth .
And if you still decide to have the baby , since the technology has been developed so advanced , it might be possible in the future that the application of altering gene is perfected and widely used , you can then choose to give birth to babies by giving them a brighter future .
Some of them may have changed their phone numbers and addresses , and we are not able to find them through a phone or a letter .
Though it is said that genetic testing involves emotional and social risks due to the test results , while the potential negative impacts of the risk still exist , the consequence will be significant if other members of his or her family do not know .
It also helps people to develop their interpersonal skills through online chating .
You are not only controlled by the government laws but also spied by the government .
A good law should be clear and easy to execute .
A family of four having dinners in a restaurant without any chatting , because their holding and looking at their display screen with one hand when the other hand is holding a fork .
And it becomes more convenient to obtain and update information by using social media .
Overall , I belive that it entirely depends on the carrier to share the hard facts and face it with relatives but he has no obligation to tell still .
Secondly , without the truly communication in the real life , people lose the ability to see the truth and false .
When our phones are accidentally done , we can also use the social media to get contact with our friends .
The users of every social media sites need to strike a balance between the real world versus the virtual one .
Generally people need they eyes to look at the display screen of their phone or computer and fingers to manipulate the corresponding device .
Secondly , although social network takes time for people to chat online but not face to face , they may still decide a time online to meet others face to face in the daily life .
From some points of view , social really has a lot of advantages by let us communicate with friends cheaper and more conveniently .
Some of the famous examples would be social media sites like Twitter and Facebook .
Also , as numerous profit-driven companies realize the hugh human traffic on such social media sites , they make it as a pond to fish the customers by uploading many advertisements .
The appearance of social media sites truly connects people closely .
In conclusion , it will be considerate to inform the risk of getting the same genetic disease to the relatives .
Again , there is a trend for them to suffer from social media addition and their study and work may be greatly influenced .
And we keep track of all family members health conditions .
Therefore their son was inherited the genetic disease .
On the other hand , it may pass the disease to the next generation if the carrier hides the truth .
To sum up , a carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to tell his or her relatives .
Besides that , the risk of the known genetic is very serious that it can not be described .
Thus , the lack of face-to-face human contact through social media restricts actual interaction which can be stimulated through the media .
Lastly , it is easy for people to waste a lot of time using social media .
Also , this known information will help their relatives to make informed decisions and tosimilarly undergo genetic testingto find out about the outcome .
With this situation , both advantages and disadvantages of using social media apply to our daily life .
Besides that , these skills requires time to develop and adapted .
Some will take long time and some are not efficient enough for people to get their response .
If the wrong testing was not found by the doctor , the family and the children may be sad and have a struggling life for their whole life .
In real life , establishing friendship requires the all-rounded understanding in one another and the caring for one another .
Ultimately , the best way to enhance interpersonal skills is still through face-to-face meetings but social media sites are only the tools to enhance it .
For a carrier of genetic disorder to know the fact that he or she is a carrier , it causes more dilemma rather than getting the disorder .
The children rely the parent to live .
One of the disadvantage that many people concerns is that people loss the interest of face-to-face communication .
People can not avoid carrying the disease genes , which they born with .
Many of the teenagers today claimed that they are able to keep in touch with their friends through social media , regardless of their location .
Telephone may be perceived as a big innovation created ever when the first time Graham Bell introduced it .
The social network may also creat some negative impacts for the people .
There are really a lot of things we need to consider .
It is better for both parties to be honest .
No pledge of authenticity risks people 's information and privacy that are shared on social media sites .
Furthermore , the annouance of genetic risk would affect the relationship with the relatives as sometimes others may think not to stay too close to the carrier so that they have less chance to get the potential disease .
In the age of rapid technological advancement , a lot of medical breakthroughs are made possible .
In conclusion , the use of social media has more advantages than disadvantages to our daily lifes .
All of us are living in the technology realm society .
The woman did not know the test result , but she overheard the talk and decided to divorce with her husband .
I do think there is difference in it and I believe many of us will agree .
The seriousness can be larger than our imagination .
I met some canadian friends in Egypt .
In conclusion,the state should have passed a legal bill to measure and provide information to doctors that till which extend should a doctor opt to reveal to relatives members about the genetic disease and in which situations it is open to patient 's decision.In addition,the state could also encourage to create assistance schemes to aid necessary help to needy patients to encourage them to open up for the benefit of own and family members.Although it may face challenges from social ethic issues,in a long term,with appropriate encouragement and aid from the government,more individuals would have a different view of acceptance and take appropriate measurements to protect their own health and their loved ones .
It saves a lot of money and time as well as strengthen our relationship although we stay at different places around the world .
An example that may serve as an illustration is breast cancer .
The debatable question , an ethical dilemma , is that are people responsible for telling their relatives that they carry a known genetic risk ?
However , we will never know whether this negative effects will happen when the carrier decide to tell his or her family of the his or her condition .
With the improvements of technology , a new life with genetic risk can be detected .
In less than a week half of the town knows person A has a risked gene , and his family might be a genetically risked family .
Therefore , this kind of circumstances will not be happened again and again .
On the other hand , when the teenager is studying in a foreign country , the internet is the only way that he can communicate with their parents and friends .
This is because many relate genetic diseases to those such as Bubble-Boy disease , autism or down-syndrome .
Some may share fewer and fewer time with their family and not knowing how to express themselves .
However , in my opinion , it is the obligation of a carrier of a known genetic risk to tell his or her relatives about his or her actual situation .
That plays an important role in the possibility that relatives can overcome the discrimination of the society and anxiety about the risks .
As for the advantages , there are two aspects : more convenient to contact others , easier to know about others .
Remember to send greetings to our friends and family frequently .
Such patients are still emotionally volatile or they may be unaware of the consequences of such genetic disorder due to their young age .
Nothing is absolute right or wrong .
It provides people with more convenient contact environment and improve the frequency of meeting with each others .
We know each others ' status , changements and so on through the social media .
It is up to people 's discretion and comprehension to decide which side they want to take .
However , some people worry that social network can affect interpersonal skills as it reduces face-to-face human contact .
Due to the popularity of social media , many people start to do their business via these sites .
The idea seems great , and nowadays most people even the older generation will have at least one social media platform like Facebook .
The lack of exposure to real life interaction with humans with not create the confidence and skills needed for one to interact seamlessly and effectively with others .
What is the basic difference between genetic disorder and other disorders .
Fundamentally , those who scored lower ranking for interpersonal skills are more likely to stumble when this skill is needed .
People should enjoy the advantages of social media while be aware of the disadvantages of that and try their best to avoid the disadvantages happen to them and their friends and family .
Human has their own rights and privacy .
Life is hard but people can not blame it on being unfair .
However , its disadvantages also can not be ingnored when you cosider it as a platform to show off and a stage for cyber crime .
The latter requires face to face interaction where we can show our emotions to the other .
If person has a disease C that might be a result of gene A .
Personally , I strongly agree that social media brings more disadvantages compared to advantages it gives us .
First and foremost , all social media sites are free .
Furthermore , some will wish not to become a burden of anyone as seeking medical attention is relatively costly .
People connecting through the social media sites can spend no money on the communication , and also take only one or a few seconds for the message to reach .
The sharing of information can be done faster through social media as well , that is why nowadays many news publishers make their own social media account , for example Channel News Asia has a twitter account and will update its follower with headline news .
However , there are risks of false information and chances of miscommunication .
Some say it is a kind of invasion of privacy for the carrier and should be protected .
They can build a daily habit to eat less salt and fat and thus to avoid hypertension .
However , some think that it might be better for those who are ignorant about it and will continue leading a happy life .
I started invoving into Facebook one years ago,when I just arrived singapore .
You can share photos , videos and every meaningful experiences of your life .
First , with the function of social media sites that connects the people , everyone is able to interact and communicate with friends and families , or even strangers without any time and place constraints .
It is hereditary .
There is a story I watched on TV .
This will result in unnecessary conflicts between two parties over miscommunication .
Whose duty it is to inform at risk relatives or not greatly depends on the personal moral and the nature of how 'directive ' the risk is to them .
Hence , our social circle is indeed expanding .
What we can do is to cautiously manage our time spent online and manage our words used online .
However , there are arguments that social media life brings in a reduction in face-to-face human contact , which in turn affects interpersonal skills .
It is weird that people sit around the table but all face to their phones and do not talk with each other .
Parents know what the best is for their children , thus they will make a right decision after they have be informed .
Some of the diseases may not show symptoms until the carrier is old enough .
But , if there is trust and mutual understand on social media , it will be ideal for people to improve relationship and make new friends .
Without facebook , we may lost contact .
It started withthe invention of technology which has evolved tremendously over the past few decades .
They may set a bias on this person even abandon his or her .
Many advantages are given to the users .
It will be really sweet and you two will surelly become closer .
How can a law made by government exempt such a group of people from preparing to face their potetial disease ?
Hence it lessens valuable interaction between human and time we spend away from the computer screen or mobile phone .
She or he does not want to be the source of unhappiness in thefamily .
Privicy protection belongs to one 's human rights .
The answer is simply that everyone , especially our family , has the right to know the truth .
When we were born , we were surrounded by our family and relatives , with them welcoming us to this new world .
One can not truly show their emotions by another by texting some = ) signs .
On one side , it is obvioualy that many advantages have been brought to our lives .
Nevertheless , they still can use phone to do normal call and message to contact .
With the huge amount of cost savings , this capital can be utilized in the other sectors which benefits company more and boost up the company 's profit .
Or else , if he holds back the genetic risk , they may have a unhealthy baby and may cause the death of the baby or end of their marriage .
In old days , if one wants to tell some important news to another one , which lives far away , he needs to write letters and it wastes time .
Also , they will not have enough experience to communicate with people in face and not be trained in their conversation skills .
We communicate with others using social media , such as twitter , facebook and microblog more and more frequently .
The usage of social media sites indirectly causes a reduction in face-to-face human communication in real life , which will in turn cause the lost of interpersonal skills for many people .
I know it will have a huge impact on them , but we should know that they are our loved ones , we need to tell them and help them .
It is againt his or her human rights and it is against the law 's spirit .
This is because by the ease of technology such as airplane , some of our friends might be going overseas to continue their studies or even you are away from your family to pursue your studies or even careers in life .
People that living in the modern world really can not live without the social media sites like Twitter and Facebook .
As the result , it is in the interests of the carriers and their relatives , telling the genetic testing result is needed .
Without increasing number of disables in a nation , the government is able to concentrate to develop in other ways like military and education .
Next , communication are also greatly improved .
Social media sites are also a very useful tool for people to start a new friendship or relationship .
Only by absorbing the essence and discarding the dregs can we make better use of the social media .
The modes of communication have been changing over the years , from letter writing to social networking .
However , it is a good practice not to intesively use social media all the time .
The most obvious reason for those who argue for this opinion is that the relatives of the carrier are at high risk of carrying these diseases .
Therefore , some carriers will have the opinion of keeping it as a secret .
The audience is not some specific person , but everyone we might know , or even the entire world .
Twitter , Facebook and Skype are some social media sites which enable us to keep in touch with our friends or family who are in other cities or countries .
For example , in 2012 , there were false rumors of fires , shootouts , and caravans of gunmen in a Mexico City suburb which had spread through Twitter and Facebook .
With the sharing of personal photos , posting of status of one 's personal feeling or experience and able to reply to these posts allowed human interaction to be engage and expand with ease .
Having support from relatives are vital as they ensure the genetic risk carrier that he/she is not alone in facing this illness and it will certainly provide a morale boost as the whole family will share a common sentiment with regards towards the future prospect of the genetic disorder which could be inherited by anyone in the family .
Nowadays , it is quite common to see on some party , people would more prefer looking at their phones and reading all the posts on facebook if they feel bored .
For people who are living very far from one another , the intensive use social media is justified .
Also , telling them the result can let them largely reduce the cost for multiple testing .
People used to write letters and send post cards to keep in touch with ones live far away from them in the past .
What we can do is to educate the public about the importance of their friends just by their side and teach them to manage their time well .
Within clicks , we could check on the friend 's profile and read on for his/her updates .
Therefore , telling the families and the relatives to get prepared for fighting the disease and even prevent to get the disease is your responsibility .
Among all kinds of different diseases , a large amount of different kinds of disorders are caused by genetic reasons .
Introverts or those who are shy to communicate with their friends are now able to do so in the form of words via social media platform .
People can use the information to deceive family and friends and banks to do bad things such as blackmail , ATM theft and so on .
People should avoid the misuse of socia media and use it in the proper way .
There may be possibilities when both the husband and wife are carriers and therefore they should not have any child since their child may not be able to survive even after they are born .
Everything comes with benefits will also have their disadvantages .
In conclude , people should think carefully of what is the consequences of telling the relatives his or her generic disorder issue .
People can know their friends ' recently looks and interesting things happens on that people just by checking their facebook or other social media sites .
This results in lack of interpersonal skills in individual , especially young students as they always have option to turn their back to the real-life and go online .
Then eventually , she discovered that eight people became one as he was using eight different identities to chat with her all the time .
Some will wish to keep it to themselves and hope to ensure that they will not bring in any pessimism into their family .
Although it looks like no laws and it is your own space to speak and do anything you want , you are actually wrong .
Nevertheless , with those advantages , some disadvantages may appear such as reduction in face-to-face human contact which affects interpersonal skills , privacy issue , as well as some frauds that can be done through social media .
Nowadays , what people need to do is just typing in front of the computer in their own rooms .
Social media sites ' role in connecting people around the world is undeniable .
Overall , there are more benefits than the costs .
Besides , we can make more friends by such interactions when our friends also bring their friends in .
Firstly , the social media sites can connect people with their friends and parents closely .
Intimate interaction greatly lack in social media interactions , particularly the touch .
So , we should never forget to think of and calculate the benefit and loss of every decision that we make .
If all efforts have been made but the children still suffer from the syndrome then the family have to accept this fact and do whatever they can to bring a good environment for their children 's growth .
They should let their spouse know about his or her situation before marriage .
To utilize the technology well , we should do our effort to not only balance the pros and cons but also lengthen the pros and shorten the cons .
However , I believe that the benefits brought by these online chatting rooms tremendously outweigh their repercussions .
Intensive use of Social media does reduce the time people spend in face-to-face communication .
An extremely interesting and ironic phenomenon was discovered that a group of friends met and sat around one table , but none of them were really chatting with one another .
Teenagers may believe these people and easily be cheat and lose money even their safe .
In the view of my point , a carrier of a known genetic risk should not be obligated to tell his or her relatives , with the support of the following reasons .
At the same time , there will also be chances that the genetic test result is not correct which means they are actually wasting their lives worrying about this thing , so actually we are bringing trouble to them .
And I am able to easily find a common topic when I contact them .
As a result , they will gradually decrease in their ability to compete with each other in the society .
Furthermore , since it is the person 's gene that is affected , he has the right to determine with whom he wants to share the information with .
People use Twitter to follow the artiste or celebrity they love and Facebook to see what is their friends ' recent activity .
If a gene runs in the family , one of the family member test positive , whom does he need to tell .
The disadvantages of social network media are quite undeniable .
Hence , the social media sites serves as a platform for the connection .
However , there rises a family-related ethical dilemma if it is right to tell a carrier 's family once the test has been conducted and the results are known .
When we are diagonosed out with certain genetic disease , are we suppose to disclose this result to our relatives ?
Therefore , the popularity of social media sites have made it more convenient for people ot update friends ' status and contact with friends more frequently .
The images we choose to present are tentatively considered .
Firstly , the information concerning to the genetic is something personally which is also a privacy like people 's bank card key .
If the result turned out something that the carrier can not accept then it would have been better not knowing the truth .
However , critics may argue that not all information or news disseminated are reliable .
Everything we type in the social media sites is recorded in the server and then transfer to the companies for spying and advertising .
At that time , the woman known how much her husband loved her but she ruined her happiness .
Hence , some seen it as being considerate in keeping the genetic risk of getting the disease in confidential .
This knowledge maybe relavant to them , and vice versa .
To tell or not to tell
In conclusion , a carrier of a known genetic risk is encouraged to tell his or her relatives about the known genetic risk .
The medical treatment technology during that time is not advanced enough to completely cure him .
The question given is whether a carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to tell his or her relatives and I think that the carrier should not be obligated to do so because I belive that he or she has right not to know .
That is because we are acting who we are in reality while we have no reason to do that in the online virtual world .
Social media provides people with the opportunity to get contact with each other every time and everywhere .
Actually , I have seen some people are very funny and interesting when I am chatting with them online .
There are still many disadvantages of using social media .
With the wide spread of advanced technology , social media sites are becoming more and more popular .
And both are not what we want since most of us just want to live as normal people .
As the case of health issue is related to genetic risk , with keyword on " genetic " which highlights the risk of passing down the disorder to the next generation .
He or she has the right not to tell anyone .
Moreover , some wrong values on the websites will affect teenagers and confuse them .
Therefore , I would agree to that it 's obligated for a carrier of known genetic risk to tell his or her relatives to avoid any family-related ethical dilemma that could be raise up in the future .
Howard Garner studied the effect of multiple intelligences amongst people and stated that interpersonal intelligence is a form of skills on its own - some has it , some does not .
It may affect our daily lives and we will think about it every day .
As stated above , I strongly believe that if we can use social media wisely rather than abusing it , we will all live a better life .
But they are all from one family and own the same forefather , then of course they own the same genes in some part .
However wife D is not even under the risk of having this disease .
This can be easily seen in restaurants or cafes nowadays .
I get news for sales , clothes and cosmetics from my friends .
As a result , the family generation stops by the moment the adult carrier announces his issue .
Personally I feel more at ease on social medias .
This shows that a facebook friend may know more about you than your close friend who does not have a facebook account .
How can they not tell their loved ones who they really are and get their loved ones in danger ?
Many people feel that we should tell our relatives since we really care about their health status .
I believe that some of the carriers will choose to not reveal their disease to the family members as they do not want to make their family members worry and feel uncomfortable or even feel ostracized by them .
The lost of interpersonal skills results in the inability for people to well present their ideas .
Through those sites we are able to talk to them , to know what their activities are and who their friends are , etc. From the surface point of view it is no doubt that these sites help us to have a better relationship with our relatives despite of the distance .
Every choice we have made may have a huge impact on their whole life .
Other than that , I believe that the stong bond we have with our family is the biggest pillar of support to the carrier .
It could rather be better for him or her this way .
People post about their random thoughts or daily activities via Twitter and post different kinds of photos on Facebook frequently , to be connected with their so called friends .
What is genetic risk ?
Genetic risk does carry its consequences and should not be taken lightly within the family circle .
Third , it is hard to define relatives .
First and foremost , I would like to share on the advantages of using such social media in my daily life .
There are advantages and disadvantages in itself , however , whether it is good or bad we are still not sure .
They have the right to know whether they are at risk .
It is a concern that will be with us during our whole life , because we will never know when the ''potential bomb' ' will explode .
They pointed that actually social media reduces the chance for us to talk to people around us face to face .
For example , on Twitter , it is exciting to follow people that you adore like famous movie and series stars , business men and entrepreneurs .
This information may not be known by the mother if she does n't tell her relatives regarding her condition .
On the other hand , the viewers , are not the listeners .
But overall , the advantages far outweigh its disadvantage .
This has been indicated in a report done by Boston University in 2012 , 80 % of information posted online is true while a person may like 3 out of 10 times in real life .
There is a situation where a family is having a dinner together in a restaurant but everybody is busy with their own gadget , posting picture in Facebook , updating status on Twitter , or even chatting with friends .
After got the divorce certificate , the man showed her the test report ; it wrote that the woman carried the disease gene instead of the man .
If the person tell their relatives that he or she carries a disease gene , his or her relatives can go to hospital to check whether they also get a disease gene .
I noticed a real story on newspaper years ago .
You can see people playing Facebook , Twitter through their smart phones or ipad on buses or on trains .
One of the diseases is sickle cell trait .
To put it in the nutshell , I believe that people should have the obligation to tell their relatives about the genetic testing result for the good of their health .
The space of separation between the parties must also be looked at .
If there is a joke on their facebook page , they may talk to others in this way , " hi , look , how ridiculous this is " , then they laugh together .
Almost all students and young adults possess the Facebook or Twitter account .
Many of them are busy in work and separate with their children .
Nowadays , people not only pursuit the comfort of their own life but also a better development of their following generations .
The burgeoning of social media definitely has its stint ; but amongst all good things , it is better to have them in moderation .
If we tell them , they may start paying more attention to their daily habits like eating less sugar contained food and keeping a good mood .
It is easier for people to accept it morally .
Therefore , people may not contact with the faraway friends and relatives unless there are something important .
We may meet only once but we exchange our contact numbers as well as facebook account in order to keep in touch .
Using a common social media site with my friends to help me know what are their statuses nowadays .
Nevertheless , the advantages of social media will benefit the masses if the negative aspects of it can be carefully taken care of .
People can promote their friendship and relationship through these social media .
However , such sparks of sudden attention is extremely short-termed and gone eaily thus does not add any value or meaning to the user 's life .
As time passed , we may have more " friends " on the list , but the meaning of friends needs to be redefined .
In addition , some may think that even knowing about having genetic risk of the disease , it will just adding on to their misery as there is nothing that they can do about it .
Think in another way , if we put those time we spend on wandering on those sites , we may already finish one book or do other more meaningful things .
The first one is the importance of being responsible for your self-wellness and health of your relatives and the second one is being responsible for the next generations .
On contrary , if the carrier is an adult , who has his own choice to choose whether to inform his or her relatives about the risk , that will be more complex .
After realizing the he or she is tshe carrier , the emotional damage would be hard to bear .
They can even make new friends over similar interests on these platforms , which will be able to connect almost everyone closely in many parts of the world .
This will then could lead to stress as these students are not able to cope with their studies because they were distracted .
Furthermore , the convenience of social media is also its weakness .
Gone were the times , and now we do mass sending and the receiver may feel less meaning in such online wishes .
Therefore , telling the relatives about the situation may avoid a lot of trouble in this way and save much time for proper treatment .
Let us take example from Facebook and Twitter , two of the most famous social media sites .
In conclusion , I think social media has reshaped interpersonal relationships from a more human-based friendship that requires sharing and caring between friends , to a more information-based friendship that requires a mutual interest .
It is unfair to release a law only point to the genetic disorder .
On the other side , as stated above , a person who want to confirm and has been prepared to face the result can choose to do the genetic testing individually .
Then nobody wants to marry A , or his relatives .
As citizens of a nation , they have the responsibility to support their country in many ways .
They play the important role in our life which can not be substituted .
This is especially to people who are overseas .
Unlike today , with the help with social media , people can easily get the information they want just by searching on line , and know about what that person did everyday at what time .
As for the disadvantages of social media in our daily life , wasting time , causing illness related to sitting long time before the computer , quick-spread of rumor and fake news , most importantly , making people lost the ability to talk to others face to face confidently .
People and friends often mock of your conditions .
Some said that the genetic risk that is found in a person should be kept secret because it is considered as a personal information which should be kept confidential .
Keeping the Secret of Genetic Testing
First , social media networks have a lot user base , it helps to link people from different parts of the world .
And if the results turn out to be otherwise , then the family can be prepared emotionally and psychologically of the future outcome and aid them in making upcoming decisions .
This kind of ethical issue can not be judged by the others because they will not understand the position and duty of the carrier in the family .
This type of communication does not help forging interpersonal relationships .
They may not able to enjoy a normal people can enjoy .
We become so anxious that we can not focus on everything .
However , there may be some special case that is hard to be defined .
With the aids of social media , people bonds globally , information flows rapidly , and human lives happily .
Do one who suffered from this disease keep it a secret of infrom their relatives ?
Families give you the courage and support which you can not retrieve by yourself .
Secondly , the carrier of a known genetic risk may destroy the peace of a family even broken the relation between children with the adult .
Another advantage of social media is in aiding the spread of democracy .
On another hand , we could update our profile by posting on the wall and our friends could read up on the newsfeed .
However , communication on social media is largely based on " broadcasting and listening " .
Usually people are not aware if they carry the sickle cell gene and this may lead to circulatory problem such as blood blocking .
In my opinion , every individual has to take responsibility of their own lives by making a right decision .
Firstly , I believe most of us will agree with the sentences below : " I will be anxious about my families when he or she told me that he or she was a carrier of a known genetic risk " .
People may feel angry , depressed , or even guilty about their results .
For example , in 2012 general election is Singapore , Dr Tan Chee Keong made use of facebook to spread his campaign videos to the public .
Thus , this makes Twitter and Facebook become one of the medium that we need .
Years ago when these modern products have not been popular , the way for people to communicate or contact people far way are still restricted in making phone calls , sending emails or writing letters .
For an example , if exercising is helpful for family potential disease , we can always look for more chances for the family to go exercise .
Recent research has shown that the more people spend time on social media sites , the less they become ambitious .
However , they behave quite boring when I talk to them in real life .
When their children become teenagers , a lot of social problems may arise .
They take too much time of using online social network and thus do not have time to have their daily meeting with people in their real life .
Disadvantages : One of the main concerns of using social media platform to communicate is credibility .
Another disadvantage that affects other people is that by only showing selected part of our lives , we build " false image " in public .
The courage to take the genetic testing and yet to inform their relatives about the risk that they may have may result in people being judgmental while actually it is just a risk and not a confirmed case .
Hence , they should be the people be grateful for and the people we would like to share the joy together .
The advantage and disadvantage of social media
Social media sites suppose be a very useful and convenient tool to use and bring people get closer in this globalised world .
Nowadays , the use of the sociall media platforms is a commonplace in our lives .
In cases where an individual has gotten to know of a genetic disorder , disclosing or otherwise , to his or her relative is solely a matter of preference within the indivdial moral system .
Everyone in the world can not stop using it every day to express their feelings or ideas and a log of other stuff which helps their friends know their lives better .
On the other hand , if there are ways can help us to control or cure the disease , we can going through thses process from the scope of the whole family .
No matter it is a party , dinner or just simply get-together , there always are some people bow their head and playing their phones even their family and friends are in front of them .
People do not have the ability to choose their gene , they should not be thought badly because of bad gene .
Nevertheless,everything in life has positive and negative effects .
The society will adapt to such phenomenon as physical interaction are transformed into cyber interaction .
Without the facial impression , it is easier to misunderstand the intention of speakers .
I think a carrier of a known genetic risk should not be obligated to tell his or her relatives .
For more convenience , sentences are shortened to simply three or four words such as lol ( which means laugh intensively ) and " asap " ( which means as soon as possible ) .
It will make him or her quite upset when they communicate in real life .
All-in-all , social media is the product of rapid technological advancement and there are more to come in future .
If the disorder symptoms reflect on a kid , the parent will be informed by the medics for sure , then the whole family will stay alert to their bodies ' condition .
With just a touch away from any meida/electronic devices , one can easily interact and communicate with his friends without much hassle .
Some family may feel hurt , with regards to their family pride or reputation , on having the knowledge of such genetic disorder running in their family .
With current booming technology , it is agreeable that people become more technology-savvy and they want to spend more time interacting with each others through social media sites , however , it does not mean that we should neglect face-to-face human interaction as it plays even a more important aspect in our life .
And so , he would have chosen not to undergo generic disorder testing and let the truth be mined forever .
Therefore , it would be better for the carrier to be obligated to tell the information to the relatives , in order to let them know and prevent the potential disease through daily exercises .
How much a genetic change tells us about your chance of developing a disorder is not always clear .
If your genetic results show that you do not have changes associated with an increased risk of heart disease , it is still possible that you develop heart disease .
Last but not least , social media does affect human interpersonal skills when people increase the time on social sites and reject chances to expose to social daily life activities as well as interacting with people .
Today , social media sites , such as Facebook and Twitter , are relatively common within the contemporary society ; and , people can communicate with each other , online or offline , on these social networking platforms .
In addition , privacy issue has become more popular nowadays since some people do not realize that they may actually share some information that they are not willing to share at the first place .
One of the reasons that the parents should be informed is that they have to decide whether they are capable to raise a child with genetic risk .
Everything is not that bad if you know how to look at the bright side with hope .
Thirdly , a lot of updating of luxury living standard as well as other show-off situations may make people 's daily life more and more grandiloquent , which is not an accurate social growing trend .
One of the examples is the 2012 riots happened in Egypt and Zambia .
Instead , we will post a seed and tag our friends to inform this kind of changments .
However , it also raised the concerns about whether it brings us more benefits or a human disaster .
Therefore , there is need to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of social media .
These sites play the role of connecting people around the world .
This subsequently leads to the poor interpersonal skills that inhibit the growth of our real social circle .
As the development of the technology , social media becomes more and more significant role in the whole world .
If you say only need to tell direct relatives , it will be against the fairness of law .
What 's more , these days social media plays an important role in spreading the information .
However , once a test has been conducted and the results are known , a family-related ethical dilemma is born .
They may collect information about that person by asking his friends , colleagues or family members .
For example , if an unmarried person has gene Aa and gene aa is sufficient for a very seriou disease .
The auto correction software is so effective when using electronic device until we did not realize the importance of writing .
The carrier should be honest with his or her feeling and I find that it is the right of the family member to know what is going on to his or her life .
Hence , they will be able to seek help from medical specialists to find a cure or to do some measures to prevent the risk of getting the disease .
Without the support of loved ones , patients ' life is no better than death .
Hence , it is essential to tell their family members about the risk of their genetic disorder both as a social responsibility and a favor to conserve the family basis .
On top of that , as the genetic risk may pass down to next generation , thus it will involve more than just one family .
Firstly of all , social media can make it more convenient for people to make friends and contact each other .
To prevent that from happening , I do feel that it is up to the person whether he wants to share the information with his family since his family may either be paranoid or judge him and act differently .
There are over thousand miles between Singapore and these two countries .
Twitter only allow users to give update that is limited to short sentences in order to spread the words fast , that only highlighted messages are delivered .
The relation between parents and children is something about love and dedication .
In this particular case , we are discussing about whether a person should tell his relatives about him having a RISK of a particular genetic disease .
Sometimes a family with potential genetic disorder risk may not be able to detect the potential harm inside their bodies as none of their members reflect any observable disorder symptoms .
However , is it the same when we keep in touch with someone virtually compared to when we meet them personally ?
With an increasing users of more than billion users from all over the world , social media sites have demonstrated clearly its success in playing an important part of our life .
Let 's examine the advantages and disadvantages of using social media in our daily life and society .
It can take a few days or weeks for those to receive the messages .
For a genetic risk carrier , there should be choice given with regards to informing his/her relatives .
Furthermore , with the current technology , smartphones are able to get access to social media sites which have made easier for consumers to use .
So for the consideration for the other family members , the relatives should be informed .
This improves the connectivity between the users .
In addition , a woman testing positive for BRCA1 would be expected to allow her brother or sister to disclose such information to a niece or nephew rather than do it herself , although this may be further complicated by an individual 's response to risk information as they not want to know .
Secondly , genetic disease has a close relationship with the born gene together with their daily habits .
While most people agree that each individual has his own right to decide whether to undergo a genetic test or not , they have different stands in whether it is the patient 's responsibility or freedom to share the result with his or her relatives .
When one of his friends who is not aware of this has failed to contact him via telephone calls , he might be able to get his whereabout using social media .
For every action there is always pros and cons .
When they grow up , they take care of the old parents and thank for their dedication .
When things come to genetic issues , it is not that simple anymore .
Being in Asian society where genetic testing is not a common practice , I do think that it is the choice of the patient whether he or she wants to tell his or her relatives about his or her disease .
Sometimes some family structure and cultural beliefs can influence the pattern of communication .
No more worries about the time it takes to deliver letters and packages .
The situation may become worst if the child has diseases like cancer or heart disease , which means that parents have another heavy baggage named medication fees .
By doing so , one will feel less stressful in facing such disorder risk .
He can even talk to her daughter face-to-face using video call via internet .
The reason behind is that after WOWII the population of China decreased dramatically and so the government encourage the people to give more birth .
Social media makes our life patten so fast and left us less time to think about our life .
And it is important for those young people .
I personally think this ist he right purpose of going through the genetic testing , so that a family who can not afford to have a disabled kid do not have to give birth to their child and make the entire family suffer .
Although it is really useful when we need to use it to let other people know we really live a good life , it wastes us a lot of time as well .
As a part of this modern society , we should learn to distinguish between good and bad impacts brought by the advancement of technologies , and also learn to avoid the cons and maximize the benefits of those sites .
Or in a less extreme case , the child may be disabled .
To prevent the bigger problem to happen , it takes a lot of effort to take care of your body .
The reason might just be that he or she just wants to " decorate " his or her face .
Although there might be a lot of challenges along the way in seeking medical attention , such as financial issue , everyone should be given the rights of knowing their family 's inherented medical conditions .
It is our responsibility to identify the advantages and disadvantages of social media sites .
More importantly , it is cheap and easy to use social media .
If they do not even know that they are at risk for a genetic disorder , how can this explain their right ?
However , there exits some disadvantages which will affect people in some degree .
On the one hand , it can tell members of the carrier 's family the possible disease they may have and can perform treatment in time if possible .
As a result , in the case that when one of the members happen to feel uncomfortable or unnormal , he or she should aware that whether the disorder in his or her body is a genetic risk or not .
Regardlessly , if the disorder is rarely to be fatal , or it does not caused any inconvenience to the carrier , revealing the truth is always the right thing to do .
There might be a possibility that the genetic disorder could also affect their relatives and any other families within the same family tree .
It also brings many negative effects such as loss of face-to-face communicating skills which is important in their working place .
Undeniable , it becomes more addicting when we spend more time busy socialising and interacting virtually .
From the example that I have mentioned earlier we can see that distance between us and our loved one are getting further apart .
As it is a genetic risk,the patient next-of-skin might have a high chance of carrying the risk,hence the need to inform their relatives is important so that necessary prevention actions could be taken before unforeseen circumstances might occur.For example,if you are the only child in a family and unfortunately,you are suffering from a genetic disease that the genetic trait might be passed on to your next generation if you have a child,hence by letting your family members aware of the situation,it would lessen family stresses and suffering on forcing you to settle down and have children.However , social ethic issues like discrimination and privacy are biggest concerns and potential barriers to enforce patients or doctors to disclose information to patients relatives.It challenges the confidentiality and privacy principles.Currently , under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 ( HIPAA ) in the United States,there is no legal obligation requirement to disclose information to relatives,it is up to the patient 's wish to disclose to their family members.Early disclosement to family members brings in positive reaction and prevention,as in the case of Angelina Jolie,she chose to disclose information and underwent treatment to reduce the risk of breast cancer significantly to under five percent.I still can recall her reason for disclosing her own story was that she does not want to live under the shadow of cancer .
This information needs to be at least acknowledged by the other party before they make the decision to get married and have children .
The awareness of your relatives and families about your genetic risk is good for your self-wellness and health of your relatives .
These social media may be tools of their campaign and manipulating the thoughts of the public .
Moreover , telling their family members the truth is the fastest and easiest way to get their support .
First of all , it can be an alert for the family members of the patient and let them be aware of the possible disease that they may also have .
There are advantages and disadvantages in using social media sites , however in this case striking balance between social media and lives is the most important thing to do .
However , social media solves these problems well .
We can not deny that the social media sites truly make the old friends do not lose the information and the chances to communicate with you even you are in a different country .
One of Manager in my working place has the same situation .
Therefore , it is our responsibility to tell the relatives to prevent the occurrence of undesired consequences .

Not only the phone did the jobs for them , but also devices like personal computer , laptop , tablet , and many other devices which are able to connect to internet .
Firstly , what is the range of the relatives ?
Here I want to share Forest'view on this issue .
For example , if social network does not exist , the business people need to meet each other face to face and it is other time consuming , even sometimes with business that is not so important , it still takes a lot time on travel which is a wastage .
On the other hand , if the genetic risk is kept as a secret , although it may benefit the carrier to a certain extend and help to keep the privacy , but it has much larger negative impacts to the family members and relatives .
It makes people worry since if all the teenagers continue using social media frequently , they will decrease the ability to talk to people .
It is not the broadcasters themselves they care about , but the content .
As people spend more and more time on such social media sites , the importance of the face-to-face human contacts has decresed .
Although it helps to connect us with our friends wherever we are , it at the same time reduces the chance for us to talk to our friends face to face which may affect our interpersonal skills .
There should not be forced or obligied to do so , as it may negatively and drastically affect the emotions of the genetic risk carrier .
Therefore , while social media sites are undoubtedly have benefits in our life , we should consider its drawbacks and thus use it wisely so that we can gain more of their benefits and it disadvantages us in the smallest way as possible .
He or she might even be adviced not to get married or have children .
In this case , the social network helps people to increase the frequency of talk .

The use of social media has largely influenced our ways in communicating with one another .
" This issue has been discussed for a long time .
With the nature that the results will be known once the tests are done , each individual that is diagnosed to be a genetic risk carrier face an ethical problem : They should warn their relatives about the risking of being the same genetic risk carrier .
To sum up , social media has advantages and disadvantages in people 's daily life .
We can even know what a friend who leave thousands of miles away eat for lunch though these kinds of social media .
The medical authorities claimed that only the individual who is at risk for a genetic disorder can make the decision to undergo genetic testing .
One of them is that it reduce the level of concentration especially among the youngsters .
However , there is a role and a sense of responsibility to inform their relatives since it is a genetic disorder .
However , if a dignosed carrier is obligated to tell his or her relatives , the relatives will be forced to know their higher chance of being genetic risk carriers .
However for some rare diseases , people who have certain gene changes are guaranteed to develop the disease .
In conclusion , social media in the contemporary society is able to help one improve relationship and make new friends , as well as , disseminate information efficiently to the masses .
Secondly , people 's over-addition may avoidably , to some degree , exacerbate social alienation , and this kind of alienation causes some social media users to suffer from the over-dependence of virtual social networking .
Especially when it is just a risk , the option is really his since he is not an actual sufferer .
One advantage is that it is more convenience to contact others by social media .
Furthermore , as it could incur spending a lots of money for the treatment , the carrier might not want to be the burden in her family .
Then his or her mother will also know the emotion and feel warm .
Moreover , people can be aware of what is going on in social situation and see the comments online and share their opinions on these websites .
We discuss every thing we like and we have more personal space.Our friends also got more access to know what we are doing and what we like .
In a conclusion , there are both advantages and disadvantages of using social media in daily life .
The importance of informing relatives of such genetic disease is vital as it may help to raise awareness and prevention towards the genetic disorder .
The emotional depression that the carrier might get and the sense of guilty can be more than expected and could be a burden in mind for the rest of the life .

With the regulation of government and relevant authorities , the virtual world would be a better world .
Above all , life is more important than secret .
However , if you have undergone and known that you are a carrier , you are responsible for your whole family .
With the welcoming of application such as Skype and Facetime , any individual can phase off most , of the olden days communication methods .

The law 's spirit also include the fairness .

However , they can avoid the disease genes being inhered to their children .
This is not the case I am talking about here .
A group of friends having high tea in a caf é without chatting as well , because they do not know what to talk but pressing on their display screen .
Nowadays , even some companies conduct online video interview with their applicants as it saves time and cost .
For instance , John is informed by his doctor that he is at risk for a genetic disorder but he does not tell his sibling , James about this .
Particularly , in the medical field , there is a great improvement in many treatments for many formally incurable diseases , and genetic testing is one of the methods which were used to diagnose an individual at risk for a genetic disorder .
Tears showed nothing .
By informing them , the carrier is never alone in fighting the battle of such disorder risk .
A lot of people use their true information on social media sites , which can lead to crimes and deception .
Personally I am study in oversea , busy study life keeps me away from contact my old friend .
In conclusion , we could tell the benefits of telling genetic risk to the carriers relatives overweights the costs .
I agree with this statement to a large extent .
For example , if you find out one of your friend 's favourite singer is Justin Biber through facebook , you can give him or her Justin Biber 's new album or concert ticket as a birthday gift .
She talked with them every night , trust them and share her life with them .
Many people are very brave in telling people about their opinions online but in real life some of them can be very shy and not outspoken at all .

Social media sites such as Facebook has allow us to share our pictures or even chat online with our parents while we are overseas .
In my opinion , as long as we keep our mind healthy and strong , we can fight any disease as they come to us when we are fragile and weak .
Firstly , someone having what kinds of disease belongs to his or her privacy .
Genetic testing has been made possible- it has become easy to tell if one is a carrier of a known genetic risk through genetic testing .
Besides that , company also can use the convenience of social media sites , such as Facebook chat or Skype to facilitate the meeting with parties of project from around the world .

Depending on whom the genetic risk was discovered from : the son or daughter for example , the parents who knows about this would decide who gets told and whom takes the precedence in being 'allowed ' to tell .
If not their family then who else that are willing to do that ?
Nowadays , as the technology is becoming increasingly advanced , more and more social media sites are showing up in our daily life .
Online friends became real life friends and real life friends communicate with one another online .
Awareness of having a genetic disorder may help in diagnosing a genetic disorder for a person , and therefore , this may make the prevention of a certain disorder possible .
Consider a case , we decide to undergo genetic testing and have known the result of it .
Social media sites are at their peaks at the moment , however , I believe that when people realize that such sites are not making them better persons in real-life , they will not be indulged in it as much as they are now .
For an example , one is able to send notifications and other information we use to have them in hardcopy previously , over the web and the process takes seconds .
So , they have to also prepare mentally .
First of all , people saves money by using internet to contact other people and reading news .
Although emocons can be used to show certain emotion , this differs from the real authentic emotion of your friends when you observed them through their body language and their facial expression .
Social media has been playing a vital important role in our lives today .
People usually get this kind of hypertesion after they become adult .
Since this will really affect their lives , what we should do is to try to make it in a positive way .
The question is whether a carrier of a known genetic risk should tell his or her relatives .
Sometimes life may even be saved if they are told early and conduct timely treatment .
Interpersonal skills , like any other skills requires practice .
Nowadays , social media sites are commonly used in the society .
A couple in China have a son of 5 years old .
Since some of the information has already been revealed on the home page , it is also easier to find some common topics to talk about .
Once you suffer from cancer , the medication cost is very expensive .
And the information collected may not be intact and true .
By typing the words and showing the pictures , people can express their emotions that they are too shy to express .
However , as the government controls most of the media .
If phone and letter are the only way to contact them , we would probably not able to find them .
This competitive world is cruel to those are not able to survive .
After he takes the test and be obliged to tell his relatives , everyone know that he is a carrier .
They worry a lot about the bad effect on the teenagers who are still developing themselves .
Imagine you are living like a normal person but suddenly one day your relative comes tells you that actually there are some possibilities that you may encounter some disease in the future , what kind of feeling are you going to have ?
If your wife is not aware of the truth and give birth to the baby , it will be possible for your child to carry the same genetic risk as well .
Nowadays , with the advancement of technology , it is easy to do a genetic testing .
For example , a grandmother may have more authority to pass on information than an aunt , even when she is not at genetic risk herself while the aunt is .
This is an issue need to be addressed as family-related ethical dilemma is involved .
There are about 50 % of the people who have learnt about breaking news from social media .
Social network sites provides us many convenience .
Hence , it is undeniable that these sites play an important role in our global inter-connected world .
More and more advertisements can be found on Facebook , whether it is our friends who sell their products or professional brands selling their products online , we can get to buy and contact the sellers through those sites , which can be considered as an advantage for us , the buyers .
But seriously , most people only post the happiest moments in their lives .
Personally I feel that we still should take our responsibility to tell them the situation .
Once his or her family or relatives know that the person does not have the relation with them .
I agree that a carrier of a known genetic risk is obligated to tell his or her relatives .
In the sophisticated era like these days , experts keep producing inventions that are meant to make life easier .
Think of the other way , if a child of the family knows that he has the risk to become a genetic risk carrier , and the risk might as well inherit to his child in the future , his whole life will be in a dilenma .
Social media sites like Twitter and Facebook are popular among people in order for them to connect to others even from different countries .
The advantages and disadvantages of using such social media in the society are elaborated on as follows .
This covenience can be percieved as almost in realtime .
In some cases , a carrier can suffer tension within a family because the result is also related to the others ' risk somehow .
Once we found we were carrying this genetic risk , it is better for us to tell our family members because they may carry it as well .
But , there will still be unreliable sources spreading false information on social media sites despite high security to control almost every social networking movement .
Moreover , this also provides an alternative way for people to contact a person whom they did not see for a very long time , such as their friends in primary school and secondary school .
May be we can trust our immediate family members but can we really trust all the other relatives ?
We can not deny that the genetic testing really helps people a lot when they face the disorder problem .
We think we are all connected through all sorts of social media , but do we really get connected or falling apart ?
While every family need to go through this or that kind of troublesome situations , the more troubles that a family has gone through together , the greater bond will be established between the family members as well as the greater amount of trust , love and understanding .
Social media enables us to explore the world far far away without paying expensive airplane tickets and sparing a one-week holiday .
And there are two basic reasons .
Have you ever wondered why we use these tools to connect ourselves with other people ?
Thus , advice from hospital plays the important role for this .
We should maximize the benefits of such platforms but be careful of its impacts on the actual life that we have .
Not only one but many developed and developing countries have the same picture .
However , not everybody is so lucky that they can make sure they do not carry any disease genes .
Thanks to them , people can get to know one another online , without having to travel to meet up for business purposes for companies or personal reasons .
Not only that , new friends can be easily met through such online platforms .
In addition , with all those " nice " guys around on the social network website , one may neglect people surrounding him or her but just communicate with friends on facebook .
Therefore , the social media is not safe which is bad to teenager 's future development .
We share ideas , stories and forge friendship based on mutual respect .
Though social media do create relationships , relationships and friendships are only firm and real if people have gone through experiences and communication in face-to-face interaction .
One can not truly understand a person with only stalking his/her facebook page where he/she carefully chooses what to present .
Socia media allows them to explain to or inform people what is going on .
It not only affect the interpersonal skills but also bad for people 's health if the ones spend to much time on the social media .
Genetic risk refers more to your chance of inheriting a disorder or disease .
This is because his or her relatives have the right to know about this .
It also reduces our sympathy .
On the other hand , it may even increase the chance of having face to face contacts amoung people .
He has to choose whether to protect his family or make his family more prosperity with a potential generic risk .
The other reason that parents should know the baby they have is a carrier of genetic risk is for a nation 's good .
That is why facial impression is one of the most important elements in social learning .
This obeys their own willingness as in they have to accept the truth which may make their following life miserable .
Or they can choose to keep silent until the next carrier is diagnosed .
People can think while typing and prepare what they want to say but in face-to-face communication , every word that comes out of your mouth and may be not well arranged is the picture of your personality .
However , it is good for sharing information .
In conclusion , social media sites cause both positive and negative consequences for people and society .
However , thanks to facebook , I can still keep in touch with them and I know what they are doing recently as we living close to each other .
However , since internet were known , telephone started to give way to social media sites .
Any individual at risk for a disorder has the right to undergo genetic testing , but whether the results should be informed to others , especially close family or relatives , is the topic that worth discussing .
However , we are able to chat with our friends without travel to the countries .
In my opinion , the responsibility of telling family and relatives is quite obvious .
This will greatly help a society to progress rapidly .
The last but not the least , with all kinds of personal information on one 's social network page , it is covenient for criminal to make use of this information to commit a crime .
In fact , requiring someone to communicate his or her own genetic risk to family members who are therefore also at risk is considered by many to be ethically dubious .
However , social network helps people to meet and chat much more easier , they can even use video chat and create group chat to chat with multiple parties at the same time .
When people want to check whether they are genetic risk carriers , they can go and approach a doctor to consult about it .
Thus , the new technology will be able to bring a prosperous future for our and next generation .
It is a common scene that two people sitting next to each other seldom talk with each other but just look at their cellphone .
If the relatives carry that disease gene , they can share the experience with him or her and give some help , they will also teach him or her how to communicate with others about this issue .
It is easier for people to approach the other after knowing the information .
People with close blood relationship generally carry some similar genes .
It involves a level of dynamic interaction which utlises the motor , thinking and verbal cortex of the mind to coordinate .
Furthermore , as it is a genetic problem , it will be better for the carrier to inform his or her family as other family member might experience the same thing .
This benefit can not be obtained through telephone or mail because people 's particular and address may change from time to time while on Facebook , people can keep in contact with old friends just by using name and photo , for example , as the identifier .
Some people fake their identities in media sites so that they can know more people or some may even cheat others .
Social media is only beneficial as long as we know how to use it in a correct and suitable way with the combination of both social media sites and daily life interaction to develop people 's potentials to the fullest .
This might be beneficial for his future if he is aware of the risk of having this disorder .
And at the same time , improves the interpersonal skill , through dynamic practises betwwen individuals and realtime presence .
Even though you can not eliminate the risk completely , you can at least try to be alert to avoiding getting the disease .
Young people can widen their relationships , meet new friends and learn wonderful things in many parts of the world .

This essay will illustrate in two aspects .
In the days without the social networks , people may not have the chance to know others from different countries or the ones they never meet before .
The certainty of what is being shared or expressed could not be proven physically as media limits this physical interaction , except when using a webcam to chat .
However , after one has registered in those social media sites which are not reliable , all the information you have filled in will be a weapon against you in the future .
Firstly , interpersonal skills may be affacted by the reduction in face-to-face human contact .

In my opinion , although the annouance of carrying a genetic risk involves the issue of self privacy , it is necessary for the carrier to be obligated to tell the issue to his or her relatives in order for them to prevent the potential disease .
This phenomenon is caused by rapidly changing technology , which has made communication to be faster than never before .

However,there are still people against the decision of revealing private information.As in the case of Alzheimer patients,it is up to the patient 's own choice to disclose information.However,research has shown that doctors have tried to interpret who,how and whom will Alzheimer disease be disclosed to minimise potential negative impact to families members ( DementiaToday,2012 ) .There are associations provide helps to Alzheimer patients like Alzheimer 's Association ( Alzheimer 's Association,1980 ) .Although there are still thousand of genetic risk diseases out there that might not be receiving all helps and supports from everyone,the needs to receive immediate understanding and support from family members is an utmost help that patients need in their difficult time .

It is normal for people to demand for a fair and similar treatment as the others and therefore it is normal for people to try to keep some of their secrets or personal issues to themselves in case some people judge them or treat them differently.Many people really love to hear what they want to hear and therefore they may just ignore the word 'risk ' and assume that the person has suffered from the disease .
Other people then are influenced by us and tend to do the same .
Firstly , when people rely on the social media to communicate with their friends and parents , they will accustom to communicate by typing and not talking .
Social media is a trending channel and a suitable mean of communications .

Many people argue that this is the most serious problem brought by social media sites .

This is the common law in the society .
Hence , with the knowledge of having genetic risk , the relatives of this genetic disease will do a medical check-up , which might save them in realising it at a earlier stage .
Some people will to post their expensive thing or the oversea places of interest they have been on the social network and get a feeling of satisfaction by doing so .
Secondly , genetic diseases costs highly for the treatment and medication .
If the parents know that one of them is a carrier and disclose the information to their relatives then they can bring their children to undergo genetic testing and do n't need to be shy of it because it is for the sake of their children 's health .
However , hospital can provide a councilor to advice the carrier about the action can be taken .

If the carrier refuses to tell the truth to his or her spouse , another life may have risk of inheriting the genetic disease .
This diagnosis can be regarded as a kind of privacy to carriers .

Most patients will be depressed after realising his or her conditions .
In a nutshell , our society ca n't push genetic problem carrier to tell his or her disease to his or her relatives but he or she should be willing to tell his or her relatives about his or her genetic problem .
Thus , whether there are more advantages or disadvantages becomes a tough question for every human being .
On the other hand , with the help of social media , some homeless people or someone who need the money to cure the disease can get the help from the world quickly because once one person know the information , his or her will share it to their " friends area " , then many people will know it and spread the information to the person who can give help .
It is a hard decision to make but with the most appropriate way , it will create great circumstances for the carrier and families in the future .

They can also take immediate measures to reduce the possibility of having this disease .
It is obvious that there will be better for one person to be worried than many .

Some people may say that telling the truth may arise some unnecessary doubts and panics which will endanger the family harmony .

Whereas , it can also make people forget to communicate to their family and friends in the real life and affect negatively to their interpersonal skills .

The communication does not focus on how we feel , or to say , each otherm , but whatever is interesting , or the content .
Thus I believe that social media sites are one of useful tool to help people known each other better .
For an example , if we change our contact numbers , we will not send SMto each of individual any longer .
The communication is also not limited in words .
In my opinion , the patients , which are carriers of some known genetic risk are supposed to share the truth with their family members .
The convenience is beyond description .
It is only after we tell them will they start paying attention to their health .
Together with the advancement of technology over past decades,medical advancement has increased exponentially and further enhancements are still constantly upgrading.Empower doctors with advance medical knowledge,doctors are able to diagnose and undergo genetic testing for patients to help them prevent and take necessary steps to protect their life.However , once a test has been conducted and the results are known,a question of disclosing the results to his or her relatives become a challenging issue to both patient and doctor.In my opinion,I feel the strong urge to support the obligation to inform patient relatives .
The issue on right to know or not to know is highly debatable although it is a genetic risk , one can not be entire sure because the genetic information could possibly result from the families of either parents - his maternal and paternal uncles , aunts or cousin .
People even prefer talk to their friends and meet their friends online and gradually reject face-to-face communication .
This kind of feeling makes people 's relationship not as stable , secure and reliable than before .
This had caused panic among the people who had flooded the local police department with numerous phone calls , and this had resulted temporarily closed of schools .
Social media sites like Facebook and Twitter are born with the intention of connecting people , from around the world .
Even for those patients with terminal diseases , the duration of their survival is 30 % longer due to the family support .
The spreading of false information can be a potential psychological threat to everyone , given that social media can disseminate information in a realtively fast speed .
Some people spend a lot of time in it and forget their real life .
They are too busy with their way too many virtual friends and some of them neglect the feelings of their real-life friends .
This is applicable to these social media sites .
As a result , it could affect their lives and studies .
What 's more they may undergo genetic test as well to see whether they are carrying it or not which is also better for them .
By doing so , less of his or her beloved ones will suffer from the genetic problem .
First of all , from the angle of human right , a genetic risk carrier should not be obligated to tell the truth to others .
The inclusion of intimate presence and relative touch could also bring a better rapport between those interacting .
If one such relative is told that he or she may have higher risk of getting sick , he or she may have be scared about the unknown life , partners , spouse and colleagues may choose to leave , and many other situations may happen which means the relative 's life may be ruined .
Secondly , the social media sites can not only connect people with their friends closely .
The reason why it is so addictive is , that the more people get into the social media , they seek attention from their friends .
If some of my friends have horrible taste on clothes and he/she posts them often , I can simply block him/her off .
Convenience and efficiency are two very important use of social media .
It is immoral and impractical .
In addition , there are also chances for people to miscommunicate with each other as they can not sense the tone of the other party over social media platforms .
Therefore I think a know genetic risk should not be obligated to tell his or her family or relatives .
When people around us know that we got certain disease , their altitudes will be easily changed , whether caring us too much or keeping away from us .
There is an element of seeking out for attention rather than expressing one 's true opinion on social networks .
Generally , the clinic or hospital will not tell the carrier 's families without the agreement of carrier .
Even when people are thousands of miles apart , social media make it possible to have interaction by keep writing comments .
So I think whatever the genetic is or whether the gene is match with their parents , it should not be told to anyone even his or her family or relatives .
From the legal aspect , the answer is no but from the ethical aspect , the answer should be yes .
Lying on the bed for the remaining life , and even die immediately , these are the consequences which we can not imagine .
Pepope do not know how to talk with others face to face , especially the strangers .
In conclusion , the showing up of social media sites is a double edged sword .
In a nutshell , a carrier of a known genetic risk should have their own right to decide whether to tell their relatives or not .
Therefore , everytime when we use social media , we should take both sides into consideration and try to avoid be affected by the disadvantages .
While social media brings convenience to people life , people are more and more willing to use social media for chatting instead of face-to-face chatting which has a time and place requirement .
The broadcasting and viewing model is not good for forging relationships .
Despite the luxury that is offered by social media , there are also harmful side effects which people may not realize it beforehand .
They may feel uncomfortable when they communicate with people face to face .
Since the technology of modern society has been so advanced , it becomes possible for people to make decision to take genetic test so as to be clear whether or not they carry genetic risk which can affect their next generation .
For example , we tend send a birthday wishes when Facebook promts us " Today is someone 's birthday " .
In the past , people used to writing letters to their friends and it will take relatively long time to send the letter over .
Therefore an entirely new dilemma is born : should a carrier of a known genetic risk be obligated to tell his or her relatives ?
Nobody can deny social media 's advantages as the benefit it provides in connecting people regardless of nationalities , races , cultures and languages .
However , there are many problems againt the execution of asking a carrier to tell his or her ralatives the cause of his or her diseases .
Furthermore this also possibly triggers the privacy issues as the Facebook allows some other profit-driven companies to have access to the information on the users .
If the knowledge of the genetic risk was to be shared within the family or relatives , there might have chances for them to have it in their blood , which they may do necessary precautions to prevent .
Relatives will certainly be supportive and show more caring towards the carrier of a known genetic risk .
