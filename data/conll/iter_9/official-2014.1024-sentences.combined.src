The last but not the least , with all kinds of personal information on one 's social network page , it is covenient for criminal to make use of this information to commit a crime .
On top of that , it is better to think about solutions for her problem with the family members as there are more heads to think about it rather than thinking about it alone and struggling on your own .
They can become anyone .
Therefore , telling the relatives about the situation may avoid a lot of trouble in this way and save much time for proper treatment .
There are advantages and disadvantages in itself , however , whether it is good or bad we are still not sure .
And even we gather together more people find themselves has less topics to talk than before and choose to digging from their social media again .
The earlier we tell them , a better habit they will arise and better for the rest of their lives .
Then they can have a healthy baby with the help of the doctors .
It is because a carrier with bad gene may not necessary have those genetic disease , if they can have coresponding healthy lifestyle before the age that the gene 's function become stronger .
Firstly , they have lost the courage to meet strangers , not even the courage to talk .
If the wrong testing was not found by the doctor , the family and the children may be sad and have a struggling life for their whole life .
People get certain disease because of genetic changes .
Social network plays a role in providing and also filtering information .
They take too much time of using online social network and thus do not have time to have their daily meeting with people in their real life .
In a nutshell , our society ca n't push genetic problem carrier to tell his or her disease to his or her relatives but he or she should be willing to tell his or her relatives about his or her genetic problem .
This knowledge maybe relavant to them , and vice versa .
In conclusion , we could tell the benefits of telling genetic risk to the carriers relatives overweights the costs .
In the past , it took a few days to receive a message as we need to post our letter and now , we can use e-mail which stands for electronic message to send messages to our friends or even use our handphone to send our messages .
Finally , the technology of testing the gene is not very mature now .
It can help us know more about each other .
This means that the students are not concetrating when they supposed to do so .
On another hand , we could update our profile by posting on the wall and our friends could read up on the newsfeed .
I find that it is important to inform especially if it is contagious , the carrier could prevent the disease from spreading out to the society .
For an example , one is able to send notifications and other information we use to have them in hardcopy previously , over the web and the process takes seconds .
What is the basic difference between genetic disorder and other disorders .
How can they not tell their loved ones who they really are and get their loved ones in danger ?
Social media does have some other advantages beside their general benefits to human being .
In addition , some may think that even knowing about having genetic risk of the disease , it will just adding on to their misery as there is nothing that they can do about it .
Once you suffer from cancer , the medication cost is very expensive .
Here I want to share Forest'view on this issue .
The children nowadays do not know what is neighbourhood games and who is staying beside them , all they know is pressing icons on the screens .
Again , there is a trend for them to suffer from social media addition and their study and work may be greatly influenced .
Therefore their son was inherited the genetic disease .
Genetic disorder inheritance is generation by generation , but not all of the offsprings show the relevant symptoms .
More people ( relatives ) know her problem , more information channel is provided .
Then it becomes troublesome about whether we need to tell our relatives who may carry this genetic risk as well .
The images we choose to present are tentatively considered .
A couple did not have a child after their marriage for a long time , their parents were anxious about that and asked them to go to hospital to check what was the problem .
In corporate world , employers often block social media network to prevent employees to spend their office time on their personal leisure than concentrating on their work .
Sometimes I even canoot sleep well because of excitement .
As we all know , genetic risk carriers are likely to pass the genetics to their family members .
This essay will illustrate the pros and cons of using social media in modern society .
Social media has reshaped the way of communication .
Firstly , what is the range of the relatives ?
After my Manager taught her mother how to use Facebook , she was able to upload video clips of her grandchild .
This had caused panic among the people who had flooded the local police department with numerous phone calls , and this had resulted temporarily closed of schools .
Then , we need to talk about the advantages and disadvantages of using social media in your daily life and society .
Hence , it is undeniable that these sites play an important role in our global inter-connected world .
Therefore , it would be better for the carrier to be obligated to tell the information to the relatives , in order to let them know and prevent the potential disease through daily exercises .
This essay will discuss the reasons why the relatives are obligated to be informed that their children have genetic risk .
However , there is a role and a sense of responsibility to inform their relatives since it is a genetic disorder .
Although emocons can be used to show certain emotion , this differs from the real authentic emotion of your friends when you observed them through their body language and their facial expression .
There is a situation where a family is having a dinner together in a restaurant but everybody is busy with their own gadget , posting picture in Facebook , updating status on Twitter , or even chatting with friends .
However , it leads to a new problem that " should a carrier of a known genetic risk be obligated to tell his or her relatives ?
This is their human right to know about that , and this may also save their lives by preventing the disorder to happen .
Fundamentally , those who scored lower ranking for interpersonal skills are more likely to stumble when this skill is needed .
This would avoid the rise of more family-related ethical dilemma .
Since some of the information has already been revealed on the home page , it is also easier to find some common topics to talk about .
Nowadays , social media sites are commonly used in the society .
If you say only need to tell direct relatives , it will be against the fairness of law .
However , social media site is a double-sided sword , it also bring in some negative effect on our daily life .
As the consequence , it affects their interpersonal skills .
They may feel uncomfortable when they communicate with people face to face .
We can not let it go .
The types of use must also be taken note of - informing , interacting , discussion and others .
What 's more they may undergo genetic test as well to see whether they are carrying it or not which is also better for them .
They may collect information about that person by asking his friends , colleagues or family members .
Unlike just keeping contact numbers that we may not even call , social media like facebook is a great way for friends from different field or even from different parts of the world to be connected .
This competitive world is cruel to those are not able to survive .
Using a common social media site with my friends to help me know what are their statuses nowadays .
This has been indicated in a report done by Boston University in 2012 , 80 % of information posted online is true while a person may like 3 out of 10 times in real life .
One of the significant advantages of using a popular social media site is that people can reach other easily , even without contact for a long time .
In conclusion , social media in the contemporary society is able to help one improve relationship and make new friends , as well as , disseminate information efficiently to the masses .
Furthermore , some will wish not to become a burden of anyone as seeking medical attention is relatively costly .
Therefore my Manager would not miss the moments of her daughter 's growth .
Nowadays , people not only pursuit the comfort of their own life but also a better development of their following generations .
In conclusion , I think social media has reshaped interpersonal relationships from a more human-based friendship that requires sharing and caring between friends , to a more information-based friendship that requires a mutual interest .
Last but not least , though genetic testing is a personal matter , telling the result to your family can improve and develop understanding and sympathy of each other as well as promoting awareness of taking care of everyone 's health .
The wolrd is incresingly becoming flat by all kinds of social network website such as facebook and twitter .
I started invoving into Facebook one years ago,when I just arrived singapore .
Parents and relatives have to work longer than expected and endlessly to foster their child if he/she is not able to foster himself/herself .
They need to ask for doctor 's advice before they plan to have a baby .
If they do not even know that they are at risk for a genetic disorder , how can this explain their right ?
People around the world could easily share their thoughts about their governments .
The relation between parents and children is something about love and dedication .
However , I thought that the genetic information is one person 's personal privacy which should be protected by the law .
Therefore , once people find they have carried the disease genes , they should be responsible to tell their relatives , at least their family members .
Above all , life is more important than secret .
There are four reasons why people do n't have to be shy and share their problems regarding genetic disorder .
Nowadays , the advancement of technologies improves the life of many people a lot .
Nowadays , what people need to do is just typing in front of the computer in their own rooms .
People use Twitter to follow the artiste or celebrity they love and Facebook to see what is their friends ' recent activity .
Information got circulated .
However , in my opinion , it is the obligation of a carrier of a known genetic risk to tell his or her relatives about his or her actual situation .
The results are disclosed to husbands and wifes .
There are advantages and disadvantages in using social media sites , however in this case striking balance between social media and lives is the most important thing to do .
When people want to check whether they are genetic risk carriers , they can go and approach a doctor to consult about it .
A good law should be clear and easy to execute .
Many people like to use language to pretend themselves , and lost confidence when they talk to each other .
Social media sites ' role in connecting people around the world is undeniable .
Secondly , without the truly communication in the real life , people lose the ability to see the truth and false .
This is not the case I am talking about here .
A genetic risk carrier should be obliged to tell
Nothing is absolute right or wrong .
However , as the government controls most of the media .
And try to bypass the shortcomings .
Thus , whether there are more advantages or disadvantages becomes a tough question for every human being .
They pointed that actually social media reduces the chance for us to talk to people around us face to face .
Some people may say that telling the truth may arise some unnecessary doubts and panics which will endanger the family harmony .
This is especially to people who are overseas .
As a result , it could affect their lives and studies .
Think in another way , if we put those time we spend on wandering on those sites , we may already finish one book or do other more meaningful things .
Genetic testing will be conducted when the individual is at risk of some possible disease .
Every family member has their human right to know what is going on with them .
However , we get less chance and less importance to talk face to face since social media is so convinient , advanced and interesting .
Those who are born into a family with a history of genetic disease should be allowed to undergo genetic testing , even though if there is no risk at all .
And also , we get a chance to talk to public people like popular stars and know their life better .
Without the facial impression , it is easier to misunderstand the intention of speakers .
Although there might be a lot of challenges along the way in seeking medical attention , such as financial issue , everyone should be given the rights of knowing their family 's inherented medical conditions .
In those diseases , many who are affected do actually have different physical characteristics compared to those without the genetic diseases .
Without their concern and support , we are hard to stay until this time .
The appearance of social media sites truly connects people closely .
When we were born , we were surrounded by our family and relatives , with them welcoming us to this new world .
So , we should never forget to think of and calculate the benefit and loss of every decision that we make .
It is unfair to release a law only point to the genetic disorder .
This becomes a huge problem when they have no choice but have to face things in real life .
Social media sites like Twitter and Facebook are popular among people in order for them to connect to others even from different countries .
To prevent the bigger problem to happen , it takes a lot of effort to take care of your body .
By making sure that they are aware of this genetic problem , they could have a full check-up for themselves and it will be better if they could even prevent it from happening to themselves .
So all the married couples go run a test and know they are not carriers.They might subconsiously see him as different and worry that he will find a wife who will carry this gene as well .
Therefore , there is need to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of social media .
If your genetic results indicate that you have gene changes associated with an increased risk of heart disease , it does not mean that you definitely will develop heart disease .
Secondly , genetic diseases costs highly for the treatment and medication .
Life is hard but people can not blame it on being unfair .
On the other hand , when the teenager is studying in a foreign country , the internet is the only way that he can communicate with their parents and friends .
It is obvious to see that internet saves people 's time and also connect people globally .
This is due to people spending comparatively more time on social networking than time on reading newpapers .
Getting connected on social media such as facebook and twitter has become a main trend as well as daily work nowadays .
With a small smart phone or a computer at school , at work or at home , we can easily make friends worldwide with a 'click ' and get to know about their life through having conversations with them , reading their blogs , photos and status .
Many people may support with a theory that every people have their right to enjoy the world , especially people with religions .
However , since internet were known , telephone started to give way to social media sites .
Furthermore , the convenience of social media is also its weakness .
Social media is only beneficial as long as we know how to use it in a correct and suitable way with the combination of both social media sites and daily life interaction to develop people 's potentials to the fullest .
If they do n't treat their body well , such as by using sunglasses or wearing sunscreen in outdoor , the chances are good that they will get skin problems that may also lead to cancer .
With the sharing of personal photos , posting of status of one 's personal feeling or experience and able to reply to these posts allowed human interaction to be engage and expand with ease .
Some may even do something wrong .
On social media , everyone is a broadcaster and a viewer .
This might be beneficial for his future if he is aware of the risk of having this disorder .
However , calling a person by using a phone and writing a person a letter require some cost , and sending a letter to a person who live far away , especially in villages , takes much time .
Secondly , the carrier of a known genetic risk may destroy the peace of a family even broken the relation between children with the adult .
It is a hard decision to make but with the most appropriate way , it will create great circumstances for the carrier and families in the future .
When ones chat on those media sites , there is no eye connection , no emotion delivery and even the expressions are typed in by using some combinations of punctuations .
Also , telling them the result can let them largely reduce the cost for multiple testing .
This is not the parent 's fault because there is still chances of the gene being inherited .
In my opinion , every individual has to take responsibility of their own lives by making a right decision .
It is just because that you do not become strong enough to overcome the hard time .
People can think while typing and prepare what they want to say but in face-to-face communication , every word that comes out of your mouth and may be not well arranged is the picture of your personality .
On contrary , if the carrier is an adult , who has his own choice to choose whether to inform his or her relatives about the risk , that will be more complex .
This saves a lot of time for me in reading newspapers and watching TV .
The audience is not some specific person , but everyone we might know , or even the entire world .
In Singapore , many Malaysian cross the sea to work here .
A father may be able to make a call to his daughter who is in other country via socia media software instead of making international call which costs a lot to normal salary family .
All of us are living in the technology realm society .
Therefore , everytime when we use social media , we should take both sides into consideration and try to avoid be affected by the disadvantages .
Of course , some people may do it to make their futures slightly happier , however , the carrier , before the testing , can choose not to go for the test and simply live with unknowns and accept the facts .
People should avoid the misuse of socia media and use it in the proper way .
The appearance of those social media sites causes those problems to be solved .
Secondly , although social network takes time for people to chat online but not face to face , they may still decide a time online to meet others face to face in the daily life .
What we can do is to educate the public about the importance of their friends just by their side and teach them to manage their time well .
If they spend too much time on these social media , it may cause some problems to their mental development .
Another disadvantage that affects other people is that by only showing selected part of our lives , we build " false image " in public .
The reason why it is so addictive is , that the more people get into the social media , they seek attention from their friends .
Students can exchange their experiences in study even they are in different countries .
As the development of the technology , social media becomes more and more significant role in the whole world .
We can know more news and cultures through socia medias .
For example , on mother 's day , people are shy to say " I love you " to their mothers so they can type it on his or her mother 's facebook page .
To prevent that from happening , I do feel that it is up to the person whether he wants to share the information with his family since his family may either be paranoid or judge him and act differently .
In my opinion , the patients , which are carriers of some known genetic risk are supposed to share the truth with their family members .
If all efforts have been made but the children still suffer from the syndrome then the family have to accept this fact and do whatever they can to bring a good environment for their children 's growth .
To the carrier himself of herself , he of she should have a feeling of resposiblity to tell his or her relatives their genetic disorder .
However , the problem is , will the people really enjoy their life if they have to stay at hospital everyday and with all the needles and endless pain ?
However , some think that it might be better for those who are ignorant about it and will continue leading a happy life .
What is genetic risk ?
I noticed a real story on newspaper years ago .
Unlike today , with the help with social media , people can easily get the information they want just by searching on line , and know about what that person did everyday at what time .
We know each others ' status , changements and so on through the social media .
In a conclusion , there are both advantages and disadvantages of using social media in daily life .
Therefore , while social media sites are undoubtedly have benefits in our life , we should consider its drawbacks and thus use it wisely so that we can gain more of their benefits and it disadvantages us in the smallest way as possible .
This will lead to a bad inter-personal skill as well as a problem of trusts .
They can even make new friends over similar interests on these platforms , which will be able to connect almost everyone closely in many parts of the world .
I think a carrier of a known genetic risk should not be obligated to tell his or her relatives .
We tend to post pictures with the best looks , status that are funny .
Thirdly , social media sites keep us up-to-date on latest news and updates from almost everywhere in the world , all with a click away on the refresh button .
These advantages also comes in handy as most of these social media sites are accessible through mobile application in our smartphones .
Despite one may argue that it 's still up to the individual to disclose such health issue or to bear it within him/herself , it 's certainly helpful to share with close relatives , for a proper discussion for solutions .
If one has a genetic disease after the test , he or she might not wish to inform the relatives as he might ended up dishearten his extended family .
It is quite significant especially for those young teenagers since they would rather go to these sites to see the news and know what happened in this world than read the newspaper every day .
Especially for the young people without marrige , if he/she is known to have some genetic risk , it may have certain chance that his/her child would carry the same disease , but not in certain .
Everyone does not want to see the scene of the broken family due to the carrier of a known genetic risk .
It will be really sweet and you two will surelly become closer .
There are two advantages and two disadvantages of using the social media in people 's daily life .
Especially when it is just a risk , the option is really his since he is not an actual sufferer .
However , there exits some disadvantages which will affect people in some degree .
Without trust and love , there is no difference between a family and a bunch of strangers living together .
Nowadays , as the technology is becoming increasingly advanced , more and more social media sites are showing up in our daily life .
Genetic risk does carry its consequences and should not be taken lightly within the family circle .
And so , he would have chosen not to undergo generic disorder testing and let the truth be mined forever .
However , its disadvantages also can not be ingnored when you cosider it as a platform to show off and a stage for cyber crime .
Genetic risk refers more to your chance of inheriting a disorder or disease .
Sometimes a family with potential genetic disorder risk may not be able to detect the potential harm inside their bodies as none of their members reflect any observable disorder symptoms .
Once one person in the family is found to be carrying risky genetic , other members in his or her family may also have the risk of disease .
People who aware of having such disorder can prevent the disorder to happen by adapting a healthy lifestyle , including having a balanced diet and at least having exercise for 30 minutes every day .
Social media helps to lessen the hassle of geographical distance and brings people closer .
Otherwise , making it an obligation will restric the choice of carriers and bring a lot of confusion to their relatives .
Or else , if he holds back the genetic risk , they may have a unhealthy baby and may cause the death of the baby or end of their marriage .
The social network may also creat some negative impacts for the people .
Firstly , interpersonal skills may be affacted by the reduction in face-to-face human contact .
If used for a good purpose , it can prevent unnecessary unhappiness , however , it could also make situation worse by revealing who the carrier is , in the family .
Also , human being should improve the medical field in order to prevent the tragedy happen .
In conclusion , the shadow always exists when there is light .
This is related to the interpersonal skill that is mentioned before , that can be decreasing qualitatively if we are used to facing gadget , not facing human being .
Furthermore , not everyone on the social media sites is honest .
Secondly , annouance the potential risk would cause the family member to be scared of this certain issue , although the factor would not be that serious , people would still fear that they would have some potential disease in the future thus go to hospital and do additional check or take more medicine in order to prevent the disease , and this creats unnecessary costs to the family .
But overall , the advantages far outweigh its disadvantage .
There is a story of a girl who lives in social media world every night in eight years .
With regard to this choice given , there must be some rules to regulate and exercise personal freedom of decision making .
At the same time , we are prepared to know when there are other members got this disease .
In my opinion , the responsibility of telling family and relatives is quite obvious .
Through the social media sites , we can chat with our friends who stay in Europe and New Zealand .
This phenomenon is caused by rapidly changing technology , which has made communication to be faster than never before .
It is just different .
In this case , if one of the family members or close relatives is found to carry genetic risk , it is better for the patient to tell his/her close relatives about the issue and let others known about the risk so that his/her familay members are able to perform some daily excesses to prevent the potential disease or they may go to hospital and check for the correspongding flows .
On the other hand , others may think that it will be considerate to tell the relatives because the latter will have a higher tendency of getting the same genetic risk .
It not only affect the interpersonal skills but also bad for people 's health if the ones spend to much time on the social media .
People and friends often mock of your conditions .
People connecting through the social media sites can spend no money on the communication , and also take only one or a few seconds for the message to reach .
Some people who are try to talk in the public can also actively take part in the group chatting via social media .
Because of this , other people start to think that our lives are full of happiness with no problem at all .
Otherwise , if the other parties did not know , they may end up with to have diabete in the future without any prevention .
This will result in unnecessary conflicts between two parties over miscommunication .
The obvious disadvantage of using social media is that the time reduction on face-to-face contact .
However , if they already know they have a gene that may make them have higher possibilities to get hypertention .
Particularly , in the medical field , there is a great improvement in many treatments for many formally incurable diseases , and genetic testing is one of the methods which were used to diagnose an individual at risk for a genetic disorder .
When we are diagonosed out with certain genetic disease , are we suppose to disclose this result to our relatives ?
Hence , with the knowledge of having genetic risk , the relatives of this genetic disease will do a medical check-up , which might save them in realising it at a earlier stage .
In my opinion , although the annouance of carrying a genetic risk involves the issue of self privacy , it is necessary for the carrier to be obligated to tell the issue to his or her relatives in order for them to prevent the potential disease .
The idea of searching for democracy is passed from Egyptians to people in Zambia quickly through the use of social media .
To put it in the nutshell , everything has its own pros and cons .
For every action there is always pros and cons .
Genetic testing has become a beneficial way to predict and protect each individual at risk for a disorder .
Thus , advice from hospital plays the important role for this .
Geographical and transportation borders are not a problem anymore because communication and information technologies were enhanced continuously .
However , there are arguments that social media life brings in a reduction in face-to-face human contact , which in turn affects interpersonal skills .
Personally I feel more at ease on social medias .
Last but not least , social media sites also link people together through allowing us to create our own groups , pages or sites to share our hobbies , interests and studies in particular subjects .
We may in actual fact communicating with a hoax Facebook acccount of a cyber friend , which we assume to be real but in reality , it is a fake account .
People can contact their friends on the internet and get their reply very fast .
Parents know what the best is for their children , thus they will make a right decision after they have be informed .
As many people realize , a genetic disorder can be related to the carrier 's relatives , that is , one of the family members is at risk for a genetic disorder means that other family members also have almost the equally risk to have it , so this problem should be treated seriously by the family .
He or she might even be adviced not to get married or have children .
People do not have the ability to choose their gene , they should not be thought badly because of bad gene .
However , critics may argue that with the existence of social media sites have reduced physical human interactions among people as they will prefer sitting in front of a computer to going out and meeting new friends .
However , there is still a diversity of point of views among the people .
In this modern world , the technologies were improved a lot compared with the last century .
Some family may feel hurt , with regards to their family pride or reputation , on having the knowledge of such genetic disorder running in their family .
Therefore I think a know genetic risk should not be obligated to tell his or her family or relatives .
It is not a heavy job for the family if they have prepare their mental first by disclosing the information of the probability that their children may suffer from the genetic disorder .
First , social media networks have a lot user base , it helps to link people from different parts of the world .
Maybe after we tell them , they will go for it and know more about themselves .
However , they behave quite boring when I talk to them in real life .
This subsequently leads to the poor interpersonal skills that inhibit the growth of our real social circle .
Indeed , I myself use Facebook just because of the friends ' contacts that I want to keep .
When people around us know that we got certain disease , their altitudes will be easily changed , whether caring us too much or keeping away from us .
In old days , if one wants to tell some important news to another one , which lives far away , he needs to write letters and it wastes time .
For example , breast cancer is a genetic disease and it can be cured if it is being realised in the early stage .
That eliminates the incomplete information disadvantage for some remote rural regions where people are less aware of what actually is happening around them .
Every choice we have made may have a huge impact on their whole life .
In conclusion , a carrier of a known genetic risk is encouraged to tell his or her relatives about the known genetic risk .
They may not able to enjoy a normal people can enjoy .
Secondly , the social media sites can not only connect people with their friends closely .
One of the reasons that the parents should be informed is that they have to decide whether they are capable to raise a child with genetic risk .
While , once they are communicating with people in their face , expressing themselves appropriately become really a big problem .
The seriousness can be larger than our imagination .
However , social media solves these problems well .
You can see people playing Facebook , Twitter through their smart phones or ipad on buses or on trains .
Or in a less extreme case , the child may be disabled .
Awareness of having a genetic disorder may help in diagnosing a genetic disorder for a person , and therefore , this may make the prevention of a certain disorder possible .
For example , if social network does not exist , the business people need to meet each other face to face and it is other time consuming , even sometimes with business that is not so important , it still takes a lot time on travel which is a wastage .
I believe most of us have the experience of suddenly forget how to write a word that we should know .
As a result , in the case that when one of the members happen to feel uncomfortable or unnormal , he or she should aware that whether the disorder in his or her body is a genetic risk or not .
In most of the countries , there is an emergence of social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter .
The other reason that parents should know the baby they have is a carrier of genetic risk is for a nation 's good .
On the other hand , it may pass the disease to the next generation if the carrier hides the truth .
As a student , I tend to meet lots of people from different background and at different settings .
More supports must be provided through different means to give better direction when one is standing of such junction whether should him/her to inform the relatives .
However , there are also some disadvantages occur due to the social media which are concerned in the society .
I believe that most of us agree with these terms .
The other advantage is that it is easier to know about others by social media .
In the end , I believe that the support in terms of mental or even monetary from your family could help the carrier to fight against the genetic disease .
Thank to those social media , the communication among people all over the world is possible and can be done with ease .
However , is it the same when we keep in touch with someone virtually compared to when we meet them personally ?
Families are our dearest in our life .
His relatives can then take measures , if this disease can some how be prevented , to stop this disease from taking their lives .
Some will take long time and some are not efficient enough for people to get their response .
However , the social media sites truly reduce the communication in face-to-face which truly affects interpersonal skills .
These social media makes people 's life much more colorful and provide a lot of fun .
Hence , there were also tensions if participants felt that they could neither pass on information to relatives who needed to know ( such as nieces and nephews ) nor persuade those with authority ( the parents ) to do so .
In a nutshell , a carrier of a known genetic risk has the responsibility to tell his or her relatives .
With an increasing users of more than billion users from all over the world , social media sites have demonstrated clearly its success in playing an important part of our life .
One can not truly understand a person with only stalking his/her facebook page where he/she carefully chooses what to present .
If the knowledge of the genetic risk was to be shared within the family or relatives , there might have chances for them to have it in their blood , which they may do necessary precautions to prevent .
As for the disadvantages of social media in our daily life , wasting time , causing illness related to sitting long time before the computer , quick-spread of rumor and fake news , most importantly , making people lost the ability to talk to others face to face confidently .
Nowadays , with the advancement of technology , it is easy to communicate wherever you are .
Being in Asian society where genetic testing is not a common practice , I do think that it is the choice of the patient whether he or she wants to tell his or her relatives about his or her disease .
It is still early for parents to decide whether they can foster a new life that are not able to work and may suffer the pain in the entire life .
Some may share fewer and fewer time with their family and not knowing how to express themselves .
For example , if an unmarried person has gene Aa and gene aa is sufficient for a very seriou disease .
As a result , they will gradually decrease in their ability to compete with each other in the society .
And there are two basic reasons .
This information needs to be at least acknowledged by the other party before they make the decision to get married and have children .
First and foremost , I would like to share on the advantages of using such social media in my daily life .
First of all , from the angle of human right , a genetic risk carrier should not be obligated to tell the truth to others .
So does social media network .
They will feel it becomes difficult for them to find any topics to communicate with other people .
Nonetheless , what seems to make us connected can be the cause that falls us apart .
This is a serious social problem and affects a lot of people .
In conclusion , the showing up of social media sites is a double edged sword .
Furthermore , as it is a genetic problem , it will be better for the carrier to inform his or her family as other family member might experience the same thing .
Furthermore , since the genetic risk or genetic disease is a very personal case , it is up to the person 's call to tell the relatives about it .
Some of the diseases may not show symptoms until the carrier is old enough .
It makes people worry since if all the teenagers continue using social media frequently , they will decrease the ability to talk to people .
In business area , social media is a good tool to develop and advertise products and services .
This is because by the ease of technology such as airplane , some of our friends might be going overseas to continue their studies or even you are away from your family to pursue your studies or even careers in life .
Everyone can easily make up the personality and characteristics they want .
Some of the famous examples would be social media sites like Twitter and Facebook .
On the other hand , social media sites also bring some negative impacts for the people and the society .
The long distance and time-consuming make spreading the messages very difficult at that time .
The child with genetic risk may not have the ability to work , to build up the family with the others and most of the time they are not acceptable for the majority .
It will make people spend more time on chatting on the internet rather than communicate face to face such that the interpersonal skill will be badly affected .
One can not truly show their emotions by another by texting some = ) signs .
However , there are many problems againt the execution of asking a carrier to tell his or her ralatives the cause of his or her diseases .
Social media has been playing a vital important role in our lives today .
However , social media may do some harm to people 's life .
It is also entire incorrect to fault social media alone for the lack of interpersonal skill .
Moreover , this also provides an alternative way for people to contact a person whom they did not see for a very long time , such as their friends in primary school and secondary school .
First of all , it can be an alert for the family members of the patient and let them be aware of the possible disease that they may also have .
It also reduces our sympathy .
Therefore , this kind of circumstances will not be happened again and again .
In addition , " social media sites will affect writing skills " , that is the point of view in society .
It could rather be better for him or her this way .
With the advancement of technology in recent years , the need to keep in-touch with people and latest news has become a tremendous demand .
This piece of information does play a role in family planning matters , therefore although no one is obliged to tell about their genetic risk to anyone , it should be encouraged to tell it to their future partner .
Researches show that face-to-face meeting frequency among people that are addicted to social media sites has been decreasing .
The modes of communication have been changing over the years , from letter writing to social networking .
We found that we actually are the genetic risk carrier .
This is the responsibility of being a parent .
Depending on whom the genetic risk was discovered from : the son or daughter for example , the parents who knows about this would decide who gets told and whom takes the precedence in being 'allowed ' to tell .
However , some people worry that social network can affect interpersonal skills as it reduces face-to-face human contact .
Secondly , social network may leak certain personal informations to the public , as the cyber environment is not perfect and not safe , people may not protect their privacy online effectively and sometimes , some people may use others personal information to deceive .
It is obvious that there will be better for one person to be worried than many .
Also , they will not have enough experience to communicate with people in face and not be trained in their conversation skills .
And both are not what we want since most of us just want to live as normal people .
Recent research has shown that the more people spend time on social media sites , the less they become ambitious .
They are too busy with their way too many virtual friends and some of them neglect the feelings of their real-life friends .
And actually lots of rescuing jobs are done with the help of social media like looking for people get lost and so on .
Whenever they need to use social media , they have to use a phone or internet .
Some people might say that it is a form of prevention of giving birth to disabled lives and making them suffer in real-life .

In retrospect , its is also ones duty to ensure that he or she undergo periodic healthchecks in their own .
Intensive use of Social media does reduce the time people spend in face-to-face communication .
Though because of this , social media is still a much fairer and more transparent online platform for the public to share ideas compared to other traditional medias .
If one such relative is told that he or she may have higher risk of getting sick , he or she may have be scared about the unknown life , partners , spouse and colleagues may choose to leave , and many other situations may happen which means the relative 's life may be ruined .
Instead , all of them were more interested in posting pictures of this " cheerful " meeting on their social media sites .
But , if there is trust and mutual understand on social media , it will be ideal for people to improve relationship and make new friends .
Think of the other way , if a child of the family knows that he has the risk to become a genetic risk carrier , and the risk might as well inherit to his child in the future , his whole life will be in a dilenma .
It is hereditary .
Let us take example from Facebook and Twitter , two of the most famous social media sites .
This covenience can be percieved as almost in realtime .
Hence , our social circle is indeed expanding .
However , I belive that the carrier has right not to obligate to tell anyone but has responsibility to take an action to prevent any ethical dilemma .
Thus , socialisation can occur seamlessly and effectively with the utilisation of such social media platforms.Meet-ups and appointments are no longer a barrier for humans to contact and communicate with one another , making human interaction possible at one 's own convenience .
He can even talk to her daughter face-to-face using video call via internet .

Genetic testing is a personal choice .
However , we will never know whether this negative effects will happen when the carrier decide to tell his or her family of the his or her condition .
The importance of informing relatives of such genetic disease is vital as it may help to raise awareness and prevention towards the genetic disorder .
More and more networking has been transferred to internet from real life .
The lost of interpersonal skills results in the inability for people to well present their ideas .
In addition , emotional preparations and the ways you explain your genetic condition is also important so that you can convey the correct information to your family and relatives and if necessary to guide them if he/she wish to conduct a similar genetic testing .
Surrounded by such concerns , it is very likely that we are distracted to worry about these problems .
Moreover , some wrong values on the websites will affect teenagers and confuse them .
For example , hypertension is partially due to genetic factors , but environmental factors also play an important role .
In the past , people used to writing letters to their friends and it will take relatively long time to send the letter over .

The convenience is beyond description .
By telling to his or her family other than being a support , they could possibly help her to get alternative solutions to the problem that she is facing right now .
Some genetic gene will pass only to boys rather than girls , some are on the contrary .
In real life , we communicate with one another as equal participants .
The advantages and disadvantages of using such social media in the society are elaborated on as follows .
Most patients will be depressed after realising his or her conditions .
However , there are also a great amount of people who against this technology .
Whose duty it is to inform at risk relatives or not greatly depends on the personal moral and the nature of how 'directive ' the risk is to them .
Social media also provides people huge brunch information about people and things that they interests .
It provides people with more convenient contact environment and improve the frequency of meeting with each others .
I also discover some of my friends ' interest which I find common with myself so that talking to one another is much more about life , study , friends , etc .
What we can do is to cautiously manage our time spent online and manage our words used online .
The courage to take the genetic testing and yet to inform their relatives about the risk that they may have may result in people being judgmental while actually it is just a risk and not a confirmed case .
They may set a bias on this person even abandon his or her .
This is an issue need to be addressed as family-related ethical dilemma is involved .
To them , social media is the only resource they can approach to know everything happened in their home country and the way they can use to show their lives to their lovers as well .

Sometimes some family structure and cultural beliefs can influence the pattern of communication .
Even for those patients with terminal diseases , the duration of their survival is 30 % longer due to the family support .
Finding old friends through Facebook , for example , is more easier than asking people around in real life .
Also , this known information will help their relatives to make informed decisions and tosimilarly undergo genetic testingto find out about the outcome .
When people get use of using socia media to contact other people , what will happen is that their interpersonal communicating skills will degrade and lost eventually .
However , once a test has been conducted and the results are known , a family-related ethical dilemma is born .
But there is possibility that the person on the other side is deceiving you in order to obtain your information against you .
In my opinion , the carrier should tell his or her relatives about it .
Tears showed nothing .
Imagine you are living like a normal person but suddenly one day your relative comes tells you that actually there are some possibilities that you may encounter some disease in the future , what kind of feeling are you going to have ?
On the other side , as stated above , a person who want to confirm and has been prepared to face the result can choose to do the genetic testing individually .
Social network sites provides us many convenience .
So I think whatever the genetic is or whether the gene is match with their parents , it should not be told to anyone even his or her family or relatives .
Most people care about their relatives , if there is no serious consequence of telling them so , I assume most of them will tell their relatives to be careful .
Take H1N1 as an example , all the people in Singapore including students at school , travelers at the Changi Airport , workers in the office as well as passengers on the street are forced by law to take their temperature and report the result to the relevant government authority in charge .

It is a common scene that almost everyone in a public transport is watching at phone or wearing a pair ear piece in this modern society today .

As a result , what should we do ?
For example , we tend send a birthday wishes when Facebook promts us " Today is someone 's birthday " .
Howard Garner studied the effect of multiple intelligences amongst people and stated that interpersonal intelligence is a form of skills on its own - some has it , some does not .

Advantages : Social media sites have greatly ease long distance communication and interaction due to its accessibility and convenience .
Several arguments have been made regarding the social media actually have some inevitable disadvantages to people .
What 's more , these days social media plays an important role in spreading the information .
Therefore , this article is written to explain the pros and cons of using social media in our daily life .
Carrier is responsible to balance his or her own interest and the benefits of family and even society .

Intimate interaction greatly lack in social media interactions , particularly the touch .
The inclusion of intimate presence and relative touch could also bring a better rapport between those interacting .
In this case , the carrier can eat less candies and chocolates to prevent intake to much sugars , and at the same time , if the carrier tell this information to the relatives , it will be useful for them to know that they may have diabetes in the future becouse of related genes and they can perform the same exercise to intake less sugar to prevent the disease .
If we tell them , they may start paying more attention to their daily habits like eating less sugar contained food and keeping a good mood .
This results in lack of interpersonal skills in individual , especially young students as they always have option to turn their back to the real-life and go online .
After he takes the test and be obliged to tell his relatives , everyone know that he is a carrier .
Therefore , to keep the information as secret to his/her future spouce would help the relationship .

The question is whether a carrier of a known genetic risk should tell his or her relatives .
I agree with this statement to a large extent .
If he chooses to live in the uncertainty that the gene holds and willing to accept it , he could do that , and it has been something that is 'normal ' to everyone in the past as gentic testing was not possible .
Social media enables people from different parts of the world to communicate with one another .
The debatable question , an ethical dilemma , is that are people responsible for telling their relatives that they carry a known genetic risk ?
In conclusion , it will be considerate to inform the risk of getting the same genetic disease to the relatives .
Also they can prevent the disease going to their offspring .
That is the most essential elements to overcome the challenges .
One can choose to tell their relatives if they are at risk .
However , social network helps people to meet and chat much more easier , they can even use video chat and create group chat to chat with multiple parties at the same time .
However , this can also be achieved from personal choice .
As for the advantages , there are two aspects : more convenient to contact others , easier to know about others .
The woman did not know the test result , but she overheard the talk and decided to divorce with her husband .
But , there will still be unreliable sources spreading false information on social media sites despite high security to control almost every social networking movement .
Many people argue that this is the most serious problem brought by social media sites .
We were crying hard but we are not alone , it 's our family and relatives that grow us up .
Therefore , I think a known genetic risk should not be obligated to tell his or her family or relatives without the person 's permission .
Without hanging out with friends or talking with friends through phone , we can know his of her latest news by scaning the webpage .
Although sometimes those genuine sharing of information may be inappropriate or even harmful , such as prevalent using of vulgarity and harsh-meaning comments , we can minimize those repercussions through strict regulations of content online .
In addition , privacy issue has become more popular nowadays since some people do not realize that they may actually share some information that they are not willing to share at the first place .

Such patients are still emotionally volatile or they may be unaware of the consequences of such genetic disorder due to their young age .
This essay will discuss about whether a carrier of a known genetic risk should tell his or her relatives or not .
People can promote their friendship and relationship through these social media .
We should keep in mind that there are still ways for us to contact with our family or friends .
Firstly of all , social media can make it more convenient for people to make friends and contact each other .
The receipent,will then receive the information almost immediately depending on the quality of the network .
Communication would have took a different turn without the easily available social media .
But they are all from one family and own the same forefather , then of course they own the same genes in some part .
For the countries like Singapore , they are short of manpower to contribute to the nation .
It can take a few days or weeks for those to receive the messages .
In conclusion , whether or not the carrier wants to tell his relatives regarding his genetic risk , the choice is his because it is his own gene and he has the full right of it .
Compared to face-to-face interaction , online conversation is easier for strangers to open their mouth to each other .
All-in-all , social media is the product of rapid technological advancement and there are more to come in future .
Everything will be bad if we do n't know how to use them wisely no matter whether it is really good or not .
Secondly , people 's over-addition may avoidably , to some degree , exacerbate social alienation , and this kind of alienation causes some social media users to suffer from the over-dependence of virtual social networking .
It also brings many negative effects such as loss of face-to-face communicating skills which is important in their working place .
Nevertheless , they still can use phone to do normal call and message to contact .
The largest negative impact is that due to the online network , some people start to use and rely on internet every minute .
However , it also raised the concerns about whether it brings us more benefits or a human disaster .
It will make him or her quite upset when they communicate in real life .
The son was died after one year 's treatment and the couple got divorced later after that .
I think the family will stay mentally healty as it is , without having emtional stress .
Although it helps to connect us with our friends wherever we are , it at the same time reduces the chance for us to talk to our friends face to face which may affect our interpersonal skills .
We can even know what a friend who leave thousands of miles away eat for lunch though these kinds of social media .
Therefore , the social media truly limit the interpersonal skills such that people lose the chance and the ability to practice talking and connect the relation between him and their friends .
The communication is also not limited in words .
It is a common scene that two people sitting next to each other seldom talk with each other but just look at their cellphone .
In conclusion , although the unsafe online environment , spend too much time on internet may be the potential negative factors of using online social networks .
Pepope do not know how to talk with others face to face , especially the strangers .
Then eventually , she discovered that eight people became one as he was using eight different identities to chat with her all the time .

Thus , the lack of face-to-face human contact through social media restricts actual interaction which can be stimulated through the media .
There is a story I watched on TV .
However , hospital can provide a councilor to advice the carrier about the action can be taken .
This is the common law in the society .

If the genetic risk carrier is a minor or a child , then most likely the decision of informing the relative should be made with the consideration of the patients parents or legal guardian .
Not only the phone did the jobs for them , but also devices like personal computer , laptop , tablet , and many other devices which are able to connect to internet .

This is because it is part of everyone 's habit to check their facebook 's page as their friends will post something new every second .

I met some canadian friends in Egypt .
In the view of my point , a carrier of a known genetic risk should not be obligated to tell his or her relatives , with the support of the following reasons .
Firstly , the social media sites can connect people with their friends and parents closely .
Genetic disorder may or may not be hirataged hereditary disease and it is sometimes hard to find out one has these kinds of diseases .
This should be accepted from the point of human right , freedom of acceptance of relatives as well as many other social reasons .
If some of my friends have horrible taste on clothes and he/she posts them often , I can simply block him/her off .
Thus , we are going to identify the advantages and disadvantages of the issue which is " should or should not " .
To the whole society , it is a duty .
The benefits of doing so are able to outweigh its disadvantages .
However , if you tell the truth to your wife and relatives , you offer a chance about whether to have child or not .
On the other hand , it may even increase the chance of having face to face contacts amoung people .
What 's more , various of cultures can be shown to us through social medias .
Firstly , I believe most of us will agree with the sentences below : " I will be anxious about my families when he or she told me that he or she was a carrier of a known genetic risk " .
With the risk of being genetically disorder , many individuals have done the decision to undergo genetic testing .
There are three reasons as follows .
If he or her not get married , he or she must tell his or her partner that he carries disease gene .
Apart from the ease of communication despite of the distance , many other advantages such as knowledge sharing and trades can be done through social media as well .
One may think that if the carrier is a caring person who loves his or her family more than himself , there is no doubt that he or she will tell his or her family about the issue .
Introverts or those who are shy to communicate with their friends are now able to do so in the form of words via social media platform .
There might be a possibility that the genetic disorder could also affect their relatives and any other families within the same family tree .
Generally people need they eyes to look at the display screen of their phone or computer and fingers to manipulate the corresponding device .
The social media is beneficial as it connect you and your loved one even though you are separated by the distance .
One of the reasons why is because as a carrier , she or he needs a mental support to go through with this situation .
Hence , some seen it as being considerate in keeping the genetic risk of getting the disease in confidential .
If the result turned out something that the carrier can not accept then it would have been better not knowing the truth .
There are still many disadvantages of using social media .
As more and more social websites such as Twitter , Facebook and Weibo which have become ubiquitous , seamless and imperative in our life , people may worry about the young generation having problems in face-to-face communication skills .
Nowadays , even some companies conduct online video interview with their applicants as it saves time and cost .
Social media sites suppose be a very useful and convenient tool to use and bring people get closer in this globalised world .
Then wife D might tell her mother , who likes to gossip on her way to the theatre .
Early pre-examination is healthy as it will cast away unwanted doubts and affect the psychological thoughts of those who are affected .

This diagnosis can be regarded as a kind of privacy to carriers .
If your genetic results show that you do not have changes associated with an increased risk of heart disease , it is still possible that you develop heart disease .
However , the friendship on such virtual world is so superficial which is not so relevant to the real-life .
In conclude , socia media benefits people in several ways but in the same time harms people .
The sharing of information can be done faster through social media as well , that is why nowadays many news publishers make their own social media account , for example Channel News Asia has a twitter account and will update its follower with headline news .
With the improvements of technology , a new life with genetic risk can be detected .
In China , the older generation with traditional culture background , will always think of having more children as well as grandchildren , to make the family liven up and stronger .
No pledge of authenticity risks people 's information and privacy that are shared on social media sites .
Aside from hearing the voice , a webcamera could also be affixed to emulate a 'real ' interaction with expressions and gestures .
Therefore , the social media is truly good for people .
Besides , there are more people shwing their pictures of yummy food or travelling experience .
Not only the child but also the entirely family will suffer .
In the past , we travel by ship and now we can use airplane to do so .
For example , diabetes is a kind of genetic disease .
People can know their friends ' recently looks and interesting things happens on that people just by checking their facebook or other social media sites .
However , as we then tend to spend too much time on this and have significantly reduced in face-to-face human contact , that eventually affects our interpersonal skills .
The issue on right to know or not to know is highly debatable although it is a genetic risk , one can not be entire sure because the genetic information could possibly result from the families of either parents - his maternal and paternal uncles , aunts or cousin .
Nowadays we can not really trust new people whom we know from social media since we will never know whether they are even 'real' .
Let 's examine the advantages and disadvantages of using social media in our daily life and society .
If the person tell their relatives that he or she carries a disease gene , his or her relatives can go to hospital to check whether they also get a disease gene .
We used to send wishes cards during festive season like Chinese New Year , and we feel so good to write one and of course to receive one with stamps on it .
Due to the popularity of social media , many people start to do their business via these sites .
Many of them are busy in work and separate with their children .
However , after one has registered in those social media sites which are not reliable , all the information you have filled in will be a weapon against you in the future .
Twitter only allow users to give update that is limited to short sentences in order to spread the words fast , that only highlighted messages are delivered .
This will greatly help a society to progress rapidly .
Therefore , with the help of technology , people are able to catch up wth each other conveniently .
Although it looks like no laws and it is your own space to speak and do anything you want , you are actually wrong .
However , I believe that the benefits brought by these online chatting rooms tremendously outweigh their repercussions .
In addition , cyber relationship can not always work in real life .
However , from the ethical point of view .
Teenagers are developing their interpersonal skills and social skills when they are growing up .
A group of friends having high tea in a caf é without chatting as well , because they do not know what to talk but pressing on their display screen .
It can be very difficult for them but necessary for the carriers and their family .
The idea seems great , and nowadays most people even the older generation will have at least one social media platform like Facebook .
The certainty of what is being shared or expressed could not be proven physically as media limits this physical interaction , except when using a webcam to chat .
And we keep track of all family members health conditions .
" This issue has been discussed for a long time .
As a result , it is important for people to know that we need to be cautious about the time we spend on these social media .
They should let their spouse know about his or her situation before marriage .
It makes people feel extreme close to their admirers ' lives and works .
By doing this ,they may be able to save some lives of their relatives .
With just a touch away from any meida/electronic devices , one can easily interact and communicate with his friends without much hassle .
Hence , it is essential to tell their family members about the risk of their genetic disorder both as a social responsibility and a favor to conserve the family basis .
Afterward , the carrier will face a serious ethical issue , which is to reveal the problem to his or her relatives or not .
This shows that a facebook friend may know more about you than your close friend who does not have a facebook account .
Then nobody wants to marry A , or his relatives .
If the wife had not hind the truth and asked for doctor 's advice before they have baby , the tragic would not happen .
Their son unfortunately fell ill and he was diagnosis a kind of genetic disease which is very serious .
Nobody can deny social media 's advantages as the benefit it provides in connecting people regardless of nationalities , races , cultures and languages .
And it becomes more convenient to obtain and update information by using social media .
As we graduate from a school , we will probably lose contact with some of our friends .
Other than that , sometimes the message of one party can not be delivered properly to the other one since the communication is done through written language , and thus the 'tone ' of the message sent and when it is received may be different .
Social media sites such as Facebook has allow us to share our pictures or even chat online with our parents while we are overseas .
For example , if a carrier is told that he/she has the risk to have diabetes .
In conclusion , the use of social media has more advantages than disadvantages to our daily lifes .
It might not be accurate to judge the other party 's feelings over social media as one may cover up their emotions while on social media .
When they grow up , they take care of the old parents and thank for their dedication .
The most obvious reason for those who argue for this opinion is that the relatives of the carrier are at high risk of carrying these diseases .
Other relatives may have the same possibilities to have such kind of disease .
In addition , it is impractical to make such a law .
Therefore , I would agree to that it 's obligated for a carrier of known genetic risk to tell his or her relatives to avoid any family-related ethical dilemma that could be raise up in the future .
From some points of view , social really has a lot of advantages by let us communicate with friends cheaper and more conveniently .
The users of every social media sites need to strike a balance between the real world versus the virtual one .
Personally I am study in oversea , busy study life keeps me away from contact my old friend .
On the other hand , without knowing any genetic disorder and accepting the fact , the family will stay positive and work together to overcome the diability .
People with close blood relationship generally carry some similar genes .
So for the consideration for the other family members , the relatives should be informed .
We are actively " presenting " fa ç ades of our lifes in front of others .
These social media serves a purpose to bind people in spite of their geographical boundaries but it does n't mean that surrounding people are neglected as the payoff .
It can make people become closer as well .
However happy they were before , there would be some barrier appears which will truly destroy the family gradually .
We can not be certain for sure the reliabilty or truth of some posts or information we received through the Inetrnet .
Therefore , people may not contact with the faraway friends and relatives unless there are something important .
And it is important for those young people .
No matter it is a party , dinner or just simply get-together , there always are some people bow their head and playing their phones even their family and friends are in front of them .
A study of New York University in 2010 shown that patients with family members around generally recovers 2-4 days faster than those taken care by professional nurses .
With the huge amount of cost savings , this capital can be utilized in the other sectors which benefits company more and boost up the company 's profit .
Social media is becoming more important and we need to think more to make it serve us better and better .
Tell them or keep this secret until we die ?
However , if a dignosed carrier is obligated to tell his or her relatives , the relatives will be forced to know their higher chance of being genetic risk carriers .
Secondly , it helps people to keep in-touch with one another .
Thus , having the knowledge that such genetic disorder is benign would be beneficial towards their emotinal thoughts .
True enough that there are lots of cancer 's patient who were given second choice to live as a normal person as they have a strong mental support from their loved one .
To sum up , social media has advantages and disadvantages in people 's daily life .
In addition , social network site can help you keep in touch with friends living very far away .
With the frequent usage and reliance of the social media and the Internet , a society that socialises through the cyber will be more advance and adapted to the highly connected world .
We may meet only once but we exchange our contact numbers as well as facebook account in order to keep in touch .
People who are not good at public chatting may be more reluctant to talk to people , and their interpersonal skills can never be improved under this situation .
Thirdly , some diseases are not noticeable and may lead to serious health problems .
Though it is said that genetic testing involves emotional and social risks due to the test results , while the potential negative impacts of the risk still exist , the consequence will be significant if other members of his or her family do not know .
Moreover , in the world we are living today , many miscarriages conducted in hospital every day .
The usage of social media sites indirectly causes a reduction in face-to-face human communication in real life , which will in turn cause the lost of interpersonal skills for many people .
Families give you the courage and support which you can not retrieve by yourself .
I believe 80 percents of people plays social media sites .
We broadcast these facades of us to others .
Nevertheless , it will depend on what kind of genetic diseases , given in the context of current medical technology .
Therefore , for an effective and efficient society , there is a need to have a balance of both social media interaction and face-to-face human interaction within its people .
The users , soon , will realise that they do not need such social media sites to keep in contact with the their friends because , if they really need somebody , they will reach the friends no matter what .
Social media sites are also a very useful tool for people to start a new friendship or relationship .
In my opinion , the carrier of a known genetic risk has to tell his or her relatives about this .
For example , on Twitter , it is exciting to follow people that you adore like famous movie and series stars , business men and entrepreneurs .
They were told that the wife 's family was carrying the polygenetic disorder and can pass only to boys rather than girls .
At that time , the woman known how much her husband loved her but she ruined her happiness .
The spreading of false information can be a potential psychological threat to everyone , given that social media can disseminate information in a realtively fast speed .
Hence , for a family in which every member is truly believing in each other and loving each other ,all these troubles are just testaments to make them stronger .
Consider a case , we decide to undergo genetic testing and have known the result of it .
Firstly , someone having what kinds of disease belongs to his or her privacy .
There are really a lot of things we need to consider .
Or they can choose to keep silent until the next carrier is diagnosed .
It is a mental unhealth and it may trigger people especially teenagers to become material .
In this case , interpersonal skill is not as important because our goal is not to impress somebody , but to get the information that we are both interested in .
There are advantages and disadvantages in this change .
Having support from relatives are vital as they ensure the genetic risk carrier that he/she is not alone in facing this illness and it will certainly provide a morale boost as the whole family will share a common sentiment with regards towards the future prospect of the genetic disorder which could be inherited by anyone in the family .
And of course , he or she will think of not having any child after getting married , and the same thought goes to the cousins as well .
If your wife is not aware of the truth and give birth to the baby , it will be possible for your child to carry the same genetic risk as well .
Unlike the use of social media , most of the interaction is done with thinking and typing .
The emotional depression that the carrier might get and the sense of guilty can be more than expected and could be a burden in mind for the rest of the life .
Although telling James about this is horrible to some extent , he should know what will be likely to be going on for him .
In conclusion , personally I feel that it is better for the carrier to inform her family members about the issue .
People usually get this kind of hypertesion after they become adult .
However , in the case pertaining to any health issue or to the extent of serious disorder , it may seems no point of sharing but this involves more than just sharing of bad news .
The law 's spirit also include the fairness .
The use of social media has largely influenced our ways in communicating with one another .
It not only is convenient and beneficial in connecting people and developing the business but it also can damage people relationships and interpersonal skills .
One of the advantages which are carried by those social media sites is that they can connect us more closely than before .
It is weird that people sit around the table but all face to their phones and do not talk with each other .
There are a lot of disadvantages that people may not realize of .
Many people think that the social media sites have benefits on the communication between people while some others argue that there are several negative impacts for the society .
If phone and letter are the only way to contact them , we would probably not able to find them .
However , there may be some special case that is hard to be defined .
With the help of social media , I become real life friends with those from online forums whom I share the same interest with .
I believe that some of the carriers will choose to not reveal their disease to the family members as they do not want to make their family members worry and feel uncomfortable or even feel ostracized by them .
Above all , social network site is like a two sided knife and people can only take good advantage of it by avoiding the possible disadvantages of it such as put less personal information on his or her facebook page .
That is true and of course it is the obligation of a family member to protect and take care of the family .
Updated news people care about can be easily obtained when you refresh your social media sites on your smart phones and laptops almost every time at any time .
Genetic testing has been made possible- it has become easy to tell if one is a carrier of a known genetic risk through genetic testing .
If certain disease genetic test is very accurate and it is unavoidable and necessary to get treatment and known by others , it is OK to disclose the result .
Through Facebook , peope are able to maintain relationship with their old acquaintances .
A person with a disorder , regardless of mental or physical disorder , is always easy to be awared by his or her families .
The opposite is also true .
The lack of exposure to real life interaction with humans with not create the confidence and skills needed for one to interact seamlessly and effectively with others .
Hence , they should be the people be grateful for and the people we would like to share the joy together .
People can express themselves through pictures or emotions .
From the legal aspect , the answer is no but from the ethical aspect , the answer should be yes .
They may do not want this truth to influence their life or want to keep it as a secret and do not others know about it .
Overall , I belive that it entirely depends on the carrier to share the hard facts and face it with relatives but he has no obligation to tell still .
Social media sites like Facebook and Twitter are born with the intention of connecting people , from around the world .
Keeping the Secret of Genetic Testing
If the carrier refuses to tell the truth to his or her spouse , another life may have risk of inheriting the genetic disease .
Since we can see both advantages and disadvantages of using social media , and we can not deny the huge benefits that have been brought to us , this main trend of using social media may be still lasting for a long time .
A typical example is genetic caused hypertension .
More importantly , it is cheap and easy to use social media .
The parents are now the " friends " of their kids , and they can now " follow " their kids more closely and on real time .
The medical authorities claimed that only the individual who is at risk for a genetic disorder can make the decision to undergo genetic testing .
Social media is a trending channel and a suitable mean of communications .
People will know about whether they carry a disease on their genes after they have done the genetic test .
Therefore , social networks brings more and more connections between people and they may have a chance to chat with people they never known before , and this helps to develop the interpersonal skills as well .
Then they are unable to have a suitable method to protect themselves and emotional preparations .
That plays an important role in the possibility that relatives can overcome the discrimination of the society and anxiety about the risks .
Secondly , people makes friends all over the world and able to update their friends his recent activity easily .
Only by absorbing the essence and discarding the dregs can we make better use of the social media .
The society will adapt to such phenomenon as physical interaction are transformed into cyber interaction .
They are just scrolling down pages of pages of pictures and statuses and see one of them which they might think it funny .
First , with the function of social media sites that connects the people , everyone is able to interact and communicate with friends and families , or even strangers without any time and place constraints .
Admittedly , it is a social obligation to be responsible for the life of other people .
If person has a disease C that might be a result of gene A .
'Privacy ' , this is the word that popular in these few decades .
And I am able to easily find a common topic when I contact them .
All in all , the appearance of social media truly helps people a lot in many areas .
However , the wife actually had already known about the polygenetic disorder before the marriage and she did not tell her husband .
On the other hand , if the genetic risk is kept as a secret , although it may benefit the carrier to a certain extend and help to keep the privacy , but it has much larger negative impacts to the family members and relatives .
The broadcasting and viewing model is not good for forging relationships .
Family members , as one the closest group of people from whom they can get comfort , is a crucial factor for them to successfully get over any possible troubles as a result of genetic disorder .
Their number of people that they know may only limited to the people they meet in daily life like classmates and working partners .
Today world is considered to be the era of social media sites like Facebook and Twitter which are attractively connecting people around the world .
As people spend more and more time on such social media sites , the importance of the face-to-face human contacts has decresed .
Debates have been around for years , that should a carrier for a known genetic risk be obligated to inform his or her relatives .
However , every year the government has to spend a lot to help the disables such as medical subsidizes and builds up special schools to educate them .
Even when people are thousands of miles apart , social media make it possible to have interaction by keep writing comments .
There is no need to for people to go out of their home to interact with others , they chat online , share pictures , tell others what they have done or funny stories .
Howard Garner mentioned that the different intelligences can be charted , in accordance of utilising tests , and ranked .
We should maximize the benefits of such platforms but be careful of its impacts on the actual life that we have .
By doing so , one will feel less stressful in facing such disorder risk .
Advantages and disadvantages of using social media in daily life
On the other side , we need to rethink about the influences brought by the social media .
One definitely has the right to disclose his or her health issues to anyone , but it 's also one 's responsibility to inform the family and close relatives .
There might be false information or hoaxes spreading around on social media .
Firstly , the information concerning to the genetic is something personally which is also a privacy like people 's bank card key .
We discuss every thing we like and we have more personal space.Our friends also got more access to know what we are doing and what we like .
The burgeoning of social media definitely has its stint ; but amongst all good things , it is better to have them in moderation .
Nevertheless , with those advantages , some disadvantages may appear such as reduction in face-to-face human contact which affects interpersonal skills , privacy issue , as well as some frauds that can be done through social media .
Then the relatives can prepare themselves to prevent the disease to occur .
This means both of his parents has gene A and they are both under high risk of having disease C. They could save the cost of runing two separate tests to see whether they are under high risk of having disease C. If he runs a test and know that he has the gene Aa .
Some say it is a kind of invasion of privacy for the carrier and should be protected .
As people feel more confident online where they do not have to face in real-life on the spot , they feel more comfortable and thus prefer communicating online .
Afterall , what affects one family may or may not affect another although the families has a common genetic make up , shared by either of the parents .
It saves a lot of money and time as well as strengthen our relationship although we stay at different places around the world .
In conclusion , social media sites cause both positive and negative consequences for people and society .
"
It is easier for people to approach the other after knowing the information .
With my social network account , I seldom read newspapers or go to news websites anymore ; because I can easily read them from the status of my friends .
Furthermore , since many teenagers and young adults are fans of social media , these information can reach them easily without them need to watch or listen to the news reports .
How do social media help change our lives ?
Not only that , new friends can be easily met through such online platforms .
The relationship between the parents and their children should not be tested only in the genetic way ; it is something much deeper and tighter .
Once his or her family or relatives know that the person does not have the relation with them .
Actually , I have seen some people are very funny and interesting when I am chatting with them online .
We ca n't make a law to push a carrier of a known genetic risk to tell his or her relatives about his genetic problem .
The genetic risk that you carry may or may not affect your health and put you in danger .
While we do know that we should not discriminate them based on their limitations , many people still do it with or without them realizing it .
Today , social media sites , such as Facebook and Twitter , are relatively common within the contemporary society ; and , people can communicate with each other , online or offline , on these social networking platforms .
Not long ago , the human genome project sponsored by several large multinational corporations ( MNCs ) has been started .
All-in-all , it depends on individual and also the nature of the disease , but he or she should be obligated to inform the relatives if there are possibilities in curing or preventing it .
Then his or her mother will also know the emotion and feel warm .
Instead , we will post a seed and tag our friends to inform this kind of changments .
They always have a choice about whether to undergo the genetic test or not .
The first one is the importance of being responsible for your self-wellness and health of your relatives and the second one is being responsible for the next generations .
Another advantage of social media is in aiding the spread of democracy .
In cases where an individual has gotten to know of a genetic disorder , disclosing or otherwise , to his or her relative is solely a matter of preference within the indivdial moral system .
Moreover , the truth can not be hidden forever but when it is revealed , more shocking and upset it will be .
Therefore , considering the people 's privacy and the existence of wrong testing , for the peace of the family , I support that a know genetic risk should not be obligated to tell his or her family or relatives without the person 's permission .
Thus , much thought need to put on the immediate family as it could caused a stir of unwanted events from the patient or the family members itself .
That is why facial impression is one of the most important elements in social learning .
If not their family then who else that are willing to do that ?
Furthermore , it will be easier to make new friends find who have simliar interests or hobbies .
Recently , the rise of social media helped people to have more closer connection with each other , it is a more convenient and cheaper way to have online contact compared with face to face meetings .
Among all kinds of different diseases , a large amount of different kinds of disorders are caused by genetic reasons .
However , it is good for sharing information .
If there is no problem , that will be wonderful .
Some say that it is a necessary step for human revolution .
Furthermore , as it could incur spending a lots of money for the treatment , the carrier might not want to be the burden in her family .
Firstly , when people rely on the social media to communicate with their friends and parents , they will accustom to communicate by typing and not talking .
And now I got over 500 friends on Facebook and buried myself with hundrends of seeds every day .
However , I believe it is just a usual reaction to this situation .
With no close relationship in real life but only close cyber friends , one is more possibly to feel lonely because the physiological need of human beings is to feel the bond with others by our five senses .
Not only one but many developed and developing countries have the same picture .
With the regulation of government and relevant authorities , the virtual world would be a better world .
With current booming technology , it is agreeable that people become more technology-savvy and they want to spend more time interacting with each others through social media sites , however , it does not mean that we should neglect face-to-face human interaction as it plays even a more important aspect in our life .
In conclusion , a carrier of a known genetic risk should not be obligated to tell his or her relatives .
They worry a lot about the bad effect on the teenagers who are still developing themselves .
As a conclusion , once you have undergone the genetic testing and being aware of carrying some specific genetic risk , there are responsibilities to your relatives , yourself , and your following generations by telling your relatives and families the truth .
Online friends became real life friends and real life friends communicate with one another online .
It is therefore I would agree for the obligation of telling the relatives of both parties when one is about to get married and have a plan for giving birth .
If they do not want to think too much of it and view it as a trouble , they may just ignore the possibility .
It is better to let the other party know the fact than after the baby is born and certain type of genetic disease is found .
It can make our life simpler .
They have the right to know whether they are at risk .
In the past , vast communication are done by one of the many such a telegram , snail mail and poor-quality voice calls .
In this case , I have to say that to err is human .
As far as I am concerned , when a couple are going to have babies , they are going to run a few tests and see whether their could have some genetic diseases .
They will consider whether to give a birth to a new baby because of this genetic problem and they will start finding ways to try to avoid their baby to carry this genetic risk as well .
One of the disadvantage that many people concerns is that people loss the interest of face-to-face communication .
They can also take immediate measures to reduce the possibility of having this disease .
As it is a genetic risk,the patient next-of-skin might have a high chance of carrying the risk,hence the need to inform their relatives is important so that necessary prevention actions could be taken before unforeseen circumstances might occur.For example,if you are the only child in a family and unfortunately,you are suffering from a genetic disease that the genetic trait might be passed on to your next generation if you have a child,hence by letting your family members aware of the situation,it would lessen family stresses and suffering on forcing you to settle down and have children.However , social ethic issues like discrimination and privacy are biggest concerns and potential barriers to enforce patients or doctors to disclose information to patients relatives.It challenges the confidentiality and privacy principles.Currently , under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 ( HIPAA ) in the United States,there is no legal obligation requirement to disclose information to relatives,it is up to the patient 's wish to disclose to their family members.Early disclosement to family members brings in positive reaction and prevention,as in the case of Angelina Jolie,she chose to disclose information and underwent treatment to reduce the risk of breast cancer significantly to under five percent.I still can recall her reason for disclosing her own story was that she does not want to live under the shadow of cancer .
And if you are not on it , you will just get lost .
If I am interested in politics , I can just follow some politics newspapers or public figures .
After came back from the hospital , the man told his parents that the problem was that he carried a disease gene so that they can not have a baby in their life time .
For myself , I am long to some places after I saw those beatiful pictures taken by my firneds .
The medical treatment technology during that time is not advanced enough to completely cure him .
Some said that the genetic risk that is found in a person should be kept secret because it is considered as a personal information which should be kept confidential .
The decision to undergo genetic testing can only be made by the individual at risk for a disorder .
With the willing of people to become the best among others , social network site now become a place to show off .
May be we can trust our immediate family members but can we really trust all the other relatives ?
It is almost imposible for us to keep way from it .
On the other hand , there are also problems with the population of the social media .
First of all , people saves money by using internet to contact other people and reading news .
Thus , long distance relationship or friendship can be maintain and keeping in touch with your circle of friends has been made much easier .
Unlike people with high proportion of skin pigment , people with albinism is prone to sunburn and other skin diseases .
Have you ever wondered why we use these tools to connect ourselves with other people ?
One of Manager in my working place has the same situation .
It started withthe invention of technology which has evolved tremendously over the past few decades .
Nowadays , the use of the sociall media platforms is a commonplace in our lives .
Since ancient times , human interact with others face by face .
Based on the statistic report , the more of the writing skills will be reduced when the more time used in the social media sites .
Within clicks , we could check on the friend 's profile and read on for his/her updates .
Everything is not that bad if you know how to look at the bright side with hope .
At the same time , there will also be chances that the genetic test result is not correct which means they are actually wasting their lives worrying about this thing , so actually we are bringing trouble to them .
We should know that although we may affect their lives , we can still let them make correct choices in the future .
The question given is whether a carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to tell his or her relatives and I think that the carrier should not be obligated to do so because I belive that he or she has right not to know .
By telling their relatives that they may have a risk of carrying the disease gene can make their family members bond closely , also many risks and conflicts can be avoided .
As the result , it is in the interests of the carriers and their relatives , telling the genetic testing result is needed .
Therefore there is nothing to be shy for or be afraid of .
Some people will to post their expensive thing or the oversea places of interest they have been on the social network and get a feeling of satisfaction by doing so .
We can not deny that the social media sites truly make the old friends do not lose the information and the chances to communicate with you even you are in a different country .
I get news for sales , clothes and cosmetics from my friends .
So we need to make best use of these social media and make it a fun way of adding some excitement when life is boring .
Since the technology of modern society has been so advanced , it becomes possible for people to make decision to take genetic test so as to be clear whether or not they carry genetic risk which can affect their next generation .
Although not everyone is good at public relationship even without the existence of the social media sites , we can not deny that it do affect some people in their ability of interpersonal skills .
In my opinion , social media websides such as Twitter and Facebook will not affect the chance for people to have face to face contact and thus negatively affects interpersonal skills .
Large numbers of patients with the genetic risk would want to keep it as a secret as the genetic risk may indicates their high chance to carry certain disease .
However , it is also bringing some social changes whereby such virtual worlds are overtaking the real-life world , resulting in some negative impacts in individuaul 's daily lives and therefore becoming a large problem in societies as a whole .
In certain aspects , social media has brought us quite a lot of convenience .
A Carrier of a Known Genetic Risk Should be Obligated to Tell His or Her Relatives
The next two paragraphs will be discussing about the advantages and disadvantages of using social media in our society .
Though social media do create relationships , relationships and friendships are only firm and real if people have gone through experiences and communication in face-to-face interaction .
Nowadays , with the advancement of technology , it is easy to do a genetic testing .
Human has their own rights and privacy .
In conclusion , everything has its two-sided affect and it depends on how we exploit it .
It has erased the boundaries of distance and time .
No more worries about the time it takes to deliver letters and packages .
Personally , I strongly agree that social media brings more disadvantages compared to advantages it gives us .
In conclude , people should think carefully of what is the consequences of telling the relatives his or her generic disorder issue .
Many of the teenagers today claimed that they are able to keep in touch with their friends through social media , regardless of their location .
With the nature that the results will be known once the tests are done , each individual that is diagnosed to be a genetic risk carrier face an ethical problem : They should warn their relatives about the risking of being the same genetic risk carrier .
Nowadays , the study in the genetic field has gone further and further due to the high-velocity technological advancement .
We tend to only share our happy moments in media .
A known genetic risk can also affect our next generation critically .
The answer is simply that everyone , especially our family , has the right to know the truth .
We can not deny that the genetic testing really helps people a lot when they face the disorder problem .
For example , in 2012 , there were false rumors of fires , shootouts , and caravans of gunmen in a Mexico City suburb which had spread through Twitter and Facebook .
Hence , the social media sites serves as a platform for the connection .
Though social media need not be necessarily bad , it must be used accordingly - for work , family , friends .
It is an obligation for a carrier to inform his relatives , but also an obligation for a family member to liven up the family .
When one of his friends who is not aware of this has failed to contact him via telephone calls , he might be able to get his whereabout using social media .
While millions of users are connect at any one time , any information can be readily available at their perusal .
However wife D is not even under the risk of having this disease .
These sites play the role of connecting people around the world .
Interpersonal skills , like any other skills requires practice .
In addition , the genetic risk carrier would be showered with moral and emotional support from their relatives if it is been made known to them .
Being the parent , you are not responsible to you next generations , since you allow the genetic risk to be passed on by generation and generation and being aware of it .
Focus on the negative side of the annouance of genetic risk first .
If the relatives carry that disease gene , they can share the experience with him or her and give some help , they will also teach him or her how to communicate with others about this issue .
However , in order for people to maintain their relationship as well as making new friends , it requires mutual trust and understanding between both parties .
In conclusion , everything has two sides of stories .
For example , within a family , regardless of who had first received genetic information , parents were seen as having the primary responsibility to pass on information to any offspring , either adult at risk .
This is because his or her relatives have the right to know about this .
This lowers the experience of human ability to interact with one another which can adversely shape one 's behaviour .
In my opinion , as long as we keep our mind healthy and strong , we can fight any disease as they come to us when we are fragile and weak .
However , there is news about the social media sites leaks users ' information to companies with cash reimbursement .
It is a method that benefits two parties which is a win-win situation .
If a law requires someone to tell others ' his or her privacy especially when the one is not willing to do so .
This kind of behaviour is not good to people 's psychological health according to a research .
This means one of his parents has gene A and one cost of testing could be saved .
Firstly , social media brings convenience to the world .
As I mentioned in the beginning , there is also disadvantages of social media tools .
Many syndromes such as Down Syndrome and Taylor Syndrome can be prevented to happen if the mother undergo proper medication and do n't consume harmful goods during the pregnancy period .
They can learn how these people succeed and they can also have the chance to talk with them and know these famous persons ' thought by using the social media .
This kind of ethical issue can not be judged by the others because they will not understand the position and duty of the carrier in the family .
Writing is an essential skill of person who express their own feelings and opinions .
Many people in our society are not well informed about many genetic diseases and many of them will most likely to judge or at least differentiate those who have genetic diseases since they feel that the patients are abnormal or 'weird' .
Furthermore , living with a secret is not a good sensation , especially if the situations of other relatives become worse , you should feel guilty and depressed .
However , it will become a controversial issue as it becomes a dilemma for a carrier of a known genetic risk to inform his or her relatives .
Last but not least , social media does affect human interpersonal skills when people increase the time on social sites and reject chances to expose to social daily life activities as well as interacting with people .
In addition , doctors usually quote a statement , " Prevention is better than curation " ; this gives us an idea that preventing a disorder to happen has far more advantages than curing it .
If the carrier does n't tell his or her relatives , it may be too late to get their support and prepare financially .
For example , in 2012 general election is Singapore , Dr Tan Chee Keong made use of facebook to spread his campaign videos to the public .
Some people fake their identities in media sites so that they can know more people or some may even cheat others .
Sometimes life may even be saved if they are told early and conduct timely treatment .
Many people says they will support the social media since it really helps them to have a closer view about how their friends are going in other parts of the world .
On top of that , as the genetic risk may pass down to next generation , thus it will involve more than just one family .
Next , communication are also greatly improved .
Usually people are not aware if they carry the sickle cell gene and this may lead to circulatory problem such as blood blocking .
Therefore , this advantage of social media sites saves money and time , and also provides convenience for many people .
As stated above , I strongly believe that if we can use social media wisely rather than abusing it , we will all live a better life .
For a genetic risk carrier , there should be choice given with regards to informing his/her relatives .
Once people 's genetic information is told to other people .
However , people now can contact with anyone all over the world who can use computer at any time , and there is no time delay of messages .
During that period , if one of the family member reflects genetic disorder symptoms , he will fell in an ethical dilenma for sure .
So , they have to also prepare mentally .
Spouses usually have very close relationships , if person A tell his family that he has this gene , his uncle C knows and tells his wife D that he needed to run a test because his cousine has this disease .
Ultimately , the best way to enhance interpersonal skills is still through face-to-face meetings but social media sites are only the tools to enhance it .
We should take the advantages of the creatures we create and try to avoid the negative effects .
Once the test is done , whether the results should be open to his or her relatives has caused social extensive controversy .
Besides that , the risk of the known genetic is very serious that it can not be described .
If there is no social media , it is difficult for people to know about a stranger .
Frequently , the intention of the carriers does not want to tell their families are to continue their own life without the anxious of families .
However , as I said earlier , it is better for the person to at least tell about the potential risk to his or her future partner since his genetic risk may affect his children later .
While every family need to go through this or that kind of troublesome situations , the more troubles that a family has gone through together , the greater bond will be established between the family members as well as the greater amount of trust , love and understanding .
The space of separation between the parties must also be looked at .
This essay will illustrate in two aspects .
A guy who is going travel for months can easily tell all of his friends about his activity .
Hence , social media has benefited the masses by equipping them with a powerful tool to disseminate information almost immediate to the people around them .
We all know that life is priceless and we have no right to judge a person 's death .
If the parents know that one of them is a carrier and disclose the information to their relatives then they can bring their children to undergo genetic testing and do n't need to be shy of it because it is for the sake of their children 's health .
Nowadays , it is quite common to see on some party , people would more prefer looking at their phones and reading all the posts on facebook if they feel bored .
Furthermore , with the current technology , smartphones are able to get access to social media sites which have made easier for consumers to use .
