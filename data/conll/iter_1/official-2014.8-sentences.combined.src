In the end , I believe that the support in terms of mental or even monetary from your family could help the carrier to fight against the genetic disease .
Therefore , considering the people 's privacy and the existence of wrong testing , for the peace of the family , I support that a know genetic risk should not be obligated to tell his or her family or relatives without the person 's permission .
Hence , they should be the people be grateful for and the people we would like to share the joy together .
Without hanging out with friends or talking with friends through phone , we can know his of her latest news by scaning the webpage .
Another disadvantage that affects other people is that by only showing selected part of our lives , we build " false image " in public .
We can not let it go .
Social media has been playing a vital important role in our lives today .
If the carrier refuses to tell the truth to his or her spouse , another life may have risk of inheriting the genetic disease .
