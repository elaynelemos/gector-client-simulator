Secondly , genetic diseases costs highly for the treatment and medication .
Although telling James about this is horrible to some extent , he should know what will be likely to be going on for him .
This essay will discuss about whether a carrier of a known genetic risk should tell his or her relatives or not .
In real life , we communicate with one another as equal participants .
To prevent that from happening , I do feel that it is up to the person whether he wants to share the information with his family since his family may either be paranoid or judge him and act differently .
In those diseases , many who are affected do actually have different physical characteristics compared to those without the genetic diseases .
Many people feel that we should tell our relatives since we really care about their health status .
The situation may become worst if the child has diseases like cancer or heart disease , which means that parents have another heavy baggage named medication fees .
Among all kinds of different diseases , a large amount of different kinds of disorders are caused by genetic reasons .
As a result , in the case that when one of the members happen to feel uncomfortable or unnormal , he or she should aware that whether the disorder in his or her body is a genetic risk or not .
The parents are now the " friends " of their kids , and they can now " follow " their kids more closely and on real time .
Therefore I think a know genetic risk should not be obligated to tell his or her family or relatives .
Personally , I strongly agree that social media brings more disadvantages compared to advantages it gives us .
The audience is not some specific person , but everyone we might know , or even the entire world .
I belive that even the carrier has the right not to know the true fact .
On another hand , we could update our profile by posting on the wall and our friends could read up on the newsfeed .
It is therefore I would agree for the obligation of telling the relatives of both parties when one is about to get married and have a plan for giving birth .
However , social media site is a double-sided sword , it also bring in some negative effect on our daily life .
Some may say that the appearance for these modern media will reduce the chance for people to communicate face to face .
So we need to make best use of these social media and make it a fun way of adding some excitement when life is boring .
It is only after we tell them will they start paying attention to their health .
However , there are risks of false information and chances of miscommunication .
The latter requires face to face interaction where we can show our emotions to the other .
Early pre-examination is healthy as it will cast away unwanted doubts and affect the psychological thoughts of those who are affected .
By doing so , one will feel less stressful in facing such disorder risk .
Facebook is like a combination of message and chatting service , personal profile , media of sharing , and other entertainment add-on ( i.e .
In less than a week half of the town knows person A has a risked gene , and his family might be a genetically risked family .
We broadcast these facades of us to others .
In conclusion , personally I feel that it is better for the carrier to inform her family members about the issue .
It has erased the boundaries of distance and time .
If one has a genetic disease after the test , he or she might not wish to inform the relatives as he might ended up dishearten his extended family .
Furthermore , as it could incur spending a lots of money for the treatment , the carrier might not want to be the burden in her family .
Social media sites such as Facebook has allow us to share our pictures or even chat online with our parents while we are overseas .
For example , hypertension is partially due to genetic factors , but environmental factors also play an important role .
Nowadays , social media sites are commonly used in the society .
However , as the government controls most of the media .
In increasingly globalised world , such platforms even enhances and compliccates the links between indivduals in the world .
Therefore , some carriers will have the opinion of keeping it as a secret .
Social media sites are at their peaks at the moment , however , I believe that when people realize that such sites are not making them better persons in real-life , they will not be indulged in it as much as they are now .
What we can do is to cautiously manage our time spent online and manage our words used online .
This skill requires practices and can not be done completely through social media .
We found that we actually are the genetic risk carrier .
We were crying hard but we are not alone , it 's our family and relatives that grow us up .
From this scope , social media has shorten our distance .
Everyone in the world can not stop using it every day to express their feelings or ideas and a log of other stuff which helps their friends know their lives better .
Furthermore , this lack of physical interaction has affected human inter-personal behaviour since communication is made through social media instead of meet-ups .
Social media has reshaped the way of communication .
On the other hand , it may even increase the chance of having face to face contacts amoung people .
We think we are all connected through all sorts of social media , but do we really get connected or falling apart ?
Nonetheless , what seems to make us connected can be the cause that falls us apart .
Many people argue that this is the most serious problem brought by social media sites .
As we graduate from a school , we will probably lose contact with some of our friends .
First , with the function of social media sites that connects the people , everyone is able to interact and communicate with friends and families , or even strangers without any time and place constraints .
It is unfair to release a law only point to the genetic disorder .
The most popular information get circulated the most so I can seldom miss it .
People can promote their friendship and relationship through these social media .
The child with genetic risk may not have the ability to work , to build up the family with the others and most of the time they are not acceptable for the majority .
However , in the case pertaining to any health issue or to the extent of serious disorder , it may seems no point of sharing but this involves more than just sharing of bad news .
This knowledge maybe relavant to them , and vice versa .
And both are not what we want since most of us just want to live as normal people .
With the regulation of government and relevant authorities , the virtual world would be a better world .
Instead , all of them were more interested in posting pictures of this " cheerful " meeting on their social media sites .
For an example , if exercising is helpful for family potential disease , we can always look for more chances for the family to go exercise .
It is able to detect the illnesses or diseases and even a child 's parentage .
In a nutshell , our society ca n't push genetic problem carrier to tell his or her disease to his or her relatives but he or she should be willing to tell his or her relatives about his or her genetic problem .
With the improvements of technology , a new life with genetic risk can be detected .
How much a genetic change tells us about your chance of developing a disorder is not always clear .
It is a hard decision to make but with the most appropriate way , it will create great circumstances for the carrier and families in the future .
This means that the students are not concetrating when they supposed to do so .
Social media are able to improve relationship and make new friends , provided that there is mutual trust and mutual understanding between both parties .
Once we found we were carrying this genetic risk , it is better for us to tell our family members because they may carry it as well .
Social media has changed our ways of exchanging information and interpersonal relationships profoundly .
In real life , establishing friendship requires the all-rounded understanding in one another and the caring for one another .
Their number of people that they know may only limited to the people they meet in daily life like classmates and working partners .
Therefore , this kind of circumstances will not be happened again and again .
In conclusion , whether or not the carrier wants to tell his relatives regarding his genetic risk , the choice is his because it is his own gene and he has the full right of it .
Social media provides people a way of talking and chatting which can never be considered as a way of communication .
From the example that I have mentioned earlier we can see that distance between us and our loved one are getting further apart .
The medical treatment technology during that time is not advanced enough to completely cure him .
He runs a test and know that he has the gene AA .
As this happens , users are more and more pron to any possible frauds .
Parents know what the best is for their children , thus they will make a right decision after they have be informed .
Although there might be a lot of challenges along the way in seeking medical attention , such as financial issue , everyone should be given the rights of knowing their family 's inherented medical conditions .
The genetic risk that you carry may or may not affect your health and put you in danger .
People may feel angry , depressed , or even guilty about their results .
This means one of his parents has gene A and one cost of testing could be saved .
Other relatives may have the same possibilities to have such kind of disease .
It is normal for people to demand for a fair and similar treatment as the others and therefore it is normal for people to try to keep some of their secrets or personal issues to themselves in case some people judge them or treat them differently.Many people really love to hear what they want to hear and therefore they may just ignore the word 'risk ' and assume that the person has suffered from the disease .
The modes of communication have been changing over the years , from letter writing to social networking .
In the past , we travel by ship and now we can use airplane to do so .
It is becoming even more convinient than talking throught the phone since it is free .
Geographical and transportation borders are not a problem anymore because communication and information technologies were enhanced continuously .
In addition , some may think that even knowing about having genetic risk of the disease , it will just adding on to their misery as there is nothing that they can do about it .
Then his or her mother will also know the emotion and feel warm .
Furthermore , the convenience of social media is also its weakness .
Hence , the social media sites serves as a platform for the connection .
Furthermore , since the genetic risk or genetic disease is a very personal case , it is up to the person 's call to tell the relatives about it .
In conclusion , the shadow always exists when there is light .
We are actively " presenting " fa ç ades of our lifes in front of others .
The lost of interpersonal skills results in the inability for people to well present their ideas .
Nowadays , as the technology is becoming increasingly advanced , more and more social media sites are showing up in our daily life .
The opposite is also true .
However , such sparks of sudden attention is extremely short-termed and gone eaily thus does not add any value or meaning to the user 's life .
This is not the case I am talking about here .
If not their family then who else that are willing to do that ?
When ones chat on those media sites , there is no eye connection , no emotion delivery and even the expressions are typed in by using some combinations of punctuations .
The users , soon , will realise that they do not need such social media sites to keep in contact with the their friends because , if they really need somebody , they will reach the friends no matter what .
Instead , we will post a seed and tag our friends to inform this kind of changments .
Intimate interaction greatly lack in social media interactions , particularly the touch .
Secondly , it can avoid genetic disease passed to the next generation when they intend to have babies .
A genetic risk carrier should be obliged to tell
In a conclusion , there are both advantages and disadvantages of using social media in daily life .
All of us are living in the technology realm society .
The relationship between the parents and their children should not be tested only in the genetic way ; it is something much deeper and tighter .
If the carrier refuses to tell the truth to his or her spouse , another life may have risk of inheriting the genetic disease .
They can also take immediate measures to reduce the possibility of having this disease .
Social media makes our life patten so fast and left us less time to think about our life .
With an increasing users of more than billion users from all over the world , social media sites have demonstrated clearly its success in playing an important part of our life .
As for the disadvantages of social media in our daily life , wasting time , causing illness related to sitting long time before the computer , quick-spread of rumor and fake news , most importantly , making people lost the ability to talk to others face to face confidently .
To them , social media is the only resource they can approach to know everything happened in their home country and the way they can use to show their lives to their lovers as well .
They have the right to know whether they are at risk .
Besides , there are more people shwing their pictures of yummy food or travelling experience .
This information needs to be at least acknowledged by the other party before they make the decision to get married and have children .
In conclusion , social media sites cause both positive and negative consequences for people and society .
You can see people playing Facebook , Twitter through their smart phones or ipad on buses or on trains .
They always have a choice about whether to undergo the genetic test or not .
Many people like to use language to pretend themselves , and lost confidence when they talk to each other .
This is their human right to know about that , and this may also save their lives by preventing the disorder to happen .
The answer is simply that everyone , especially our family , has the right to know the truth .
To sum up , a carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to tell his or her relatives .
As a result , what should we do ?
Hence , social media has benefited the masses by equipping them with a powerful tool to disseminate information almost immediate to the people around them .
However , we are able to chat with our friends without travel to the countries .
Nowadays , what people need to do is just typing in front of the computer in their own rooms .
Thus , you can see that some students will browse facebook while attending lectures .
It also helps people to develop their interpersonal skills through online chating .
This benefit can not be obtained through telephone or mail because people 's particular and address may change from time to time while on Facebook , people can keep in contact with old friends just by using name and photo , for example , as the identifier .
The sharing of information can be done faster through social media as well , that is why nowadays many news publishers make their own social media account , for example Channel News Asia has a twitter account and will update its follower with headline news .
Families give you the courage and support which you can not retrieve by yourself .
Socia media allows them to explain to or inform people what is going on .
After came back from the hospital , the man told his parents that the problem was that he carried a disease gene so that they can not have a baby in their life time .
With this situation , both advantages and disadvantages of using social media apply to our daily life .
Through the social media sites , we can chat with our friends who stay in Europe and New Zealand .
Hence , there were also tensions if participants felt that they could neither pass on information to relatives who needed to know ( such as nieces and nephews ) nor persuade those with authority ( the parents ) to do so .
It involves a level of dynamic interaction which utlises the motor , thinking and verbal cortex of the mind to coordinate .
From some points of view , social really has a lot of advantages by let us communicate with friends cheaper and more conveniently .
We ca n't make a law to push a carrier of a known genetic risk to tell his or her relatives about his genetic problem .
However , they can avoid the disease genes being inhered to their children .
Nowadays , the use of the sociall media platforms is a commonplace in our lives .
On one hand , we do not want this potential danger causing firghtenning affects in our families ' later lives .
Privicy protection belongs to one 's human rights .
That is why facial impression is one of the most important elements in social learning .
By doing this ,they may be able to save some lives of their relatives .
There are advantages and disadvantages in this change .
To prevent the bigger problem to happen , it takes a lot of effort to take care of your body .
Some people will to post their expensive thing or the oversea places of interest they have been on the social network and get a feeling of satisfaction by doing so .
Third , it is hard to define relatives .
To the whole society , it is a duty .
This kind of behaviour is not good to people 's psychological health according to a research .
However , it is good for sharing information .
Then it becomes troublesome about whether we need to tell our relatives who may carry this genetic risk as well .
In this essay , few arguments will be pointed out in the support of view for any carrier of that known genetic risk to tell his or her relatives .
Spouses usually have very close relationships , if person A tell his family that he has this gene , his uncle C knows and tells his wife D that he needed to run a test because his cousine has this disease .
Nowadays we can not really trust new people whom we know from social media since we will never know whether they are even 'real' .
However , once a test has been conducted and the results are known , a family-related ethical dilemma is born .
In a nutshell , every sword has two edges .
The advantages and disadvantages of using such social media in the society are elaborated on as follows .
Otherwise , making it an obligation will restric the choice of carriers and bring a lot of confusion to their relatives .
By telling to his or her family other than being a support , they could possibly help her to get alternative solutions to the problem that she is facing right now .
As a result , they will gradually decrease in their ability to compete with each other in the society .
People with close blood relationship generally carry some similar genes .
In fact , requiring someone to communicate his or her own genetic risk to family members who are therefore also at risk is considered by many to be ethically dubious .
The debatable question , an ethical dilemma , is that are people responsible for telling their relatives that they carry a known genetic risk ?
Another problem with social media is that , the benefits from investing such enormous time and energy is not relfected as something positive to the users .
They play the important role in our life which can not be substituted .
I could understand the feeling of the carrier .
She talked with them every night , trust them and share her life with them .
They can learn how these people succeed and they can also have the chance to talk with them and know these famous persons ' thought by using the social media .
Once his or her family or relatives know that the person does not have the relation with them .
In my opinion , the carrier of a known genetic risk has to tell his or her relatives about this .
It started withthe invention of technology which has evolved tremendously over the past few decades .
In conclusion , a carrier of a known genetic risk is encouraged to tell his or her relatives about the known genetic risk .
As people feel more confident online where they do not have to face in real-life on the spot , they feel more comfortable and thus prefer communicating online .
Because if you are carrying that genetic risk , then there is great possibility that your relatives like parents or siblings are carrying the same genetic risk as well .
Genetic disorders are innate , but the great improvement of medical treatment makes it possible for humans to prevent the disorder or to reduce the negative effects of the disorder on themselves .
One of the significant advantages of using a popular social media site is that people can reach other easily , even without contact for a long time .
And if you are not on it , you will just get lost .
First and foremost , I would like to share on the advantages of using such social media in my daily life .
One should have the full control of his/her information and it is his/her right to decide whether or not to disclose it to some one else .
Generally people need they eyes to look at the display screen of their phone or computer and fingers to manipulate the corresponding device .
Nevertheless , they still can use phone to do normal call and message to contact .
Just as the lyrics of Kelly Clarkson , what does n't kill you make you stronger .
Social media is only beneficial as long as we know how to use it in a correct and suitable way with the combination of both social media sites and daily life interaction to develop people 's potentials to the fullest .
On the other hand , it may pass the disease to the next generation if the carrier hides the truth .
Last but not least , though genetic testing is a personal matter , telling the result to your family can improve and develop understanding and sympathy of each other as well as promoting awareness of taking care of everyone 's health .
As people spend more and more time on such social media sites , the importance of the face-to-face human contacts has decresed .
This obeys their own willingness as in they have to accept the truth which may make their following life miserable .
A study of New York University in 2010 shown that patients with family members around generally recovers 2-4 days faster than those taken care by professional nurses .
With no close relationship in real life but only close cyber friends , one is more possibly to feel lonely because the physiological need of human beings is to feel the bond with others by our five senses .
Firstly , when people rely on the social media to communicate with their friends and parents , they will accustom to communicate by typing and not talking .
However , communication on social media is largely based on " broadcasting and listening " .
Or they can choose to keep silent until the next carrier is diagnosed .
On top of that , it is better to think about solutions for her problem with the family members as there are more heads to think about it rather than thinking about it alone and struggling on your own .
In the past decades , when the social media sites are not yet fully developed , people connect with others who live far away by using a phone , or even a letter .
That eliminates the incomplete information disadvantage for some remote rural regions where people are less aware of what actually is happening around them .
One of them is that it reduce the level of concentration especially among the youngsters .
Therefore , I thought a known genetic risk should not be obligated to tell his or her family or relatives .
Demon is not easily to be defeated and it is required much of energy and psychological support .
However happy they were before , there would be some barrier appears which will truly destroy the family gradually .
Also , they will not have enough experience to communicate with people in face and not be trained in their conversation skills .
Thus , we are going to identify the advantages and disadvantages of the issue which is " should or should not " .
The more time we spend on these sites , the lesser time we spend on face-to-face interacting with one another .
This type of communication does not help forging interpersonal relationships .
Families are our dearest in our life .
This subsequently leads to the poor interpersonal skills that inhibit the growth of our real social circle .
However , there is news about the social media sites leaks users ' information to companies with cash reimbursement .
A Carrier of a Known Genetic Risk Should be Obligated to Tell His or Her Relatives
One may think that if the carrier is a caring person who loves his or her family more than himself , there is no doubt that he or she will tell his or her family about the issue .
Based on the statistic report , the more of the writing skills will be reduced when the more time used in the social media sites .
Hence , some seen it as being considerate in keeping the genetic risk of getting the disease in confidential .
As a part of this modern society , we should learn to distinguish between good and bad impacts brought by the advancement of technologies , and also learn to avoid the cons and maximize the benefits of those sites .
Some of the famous examples would be social media sites like Twitter and Facebook .
However , there may be some special case that is hard to be defined .
It is againt his or her human rights and it is against the law 's spirit .
Hence it lessens valuable interaction between human and time we spend away from the computer screen or mobile phone .
When we are far away , social media makes it as we are infront of each other ; sometimes when we are by each others ' side , we are seem to be further than far away .
So all the married couples go run a test and know they are not carriers.They might subconsiously see him as different and worry that he will find a wife who will carry this gene as well .
I noticed a real story on newspaper years ago .
In conclusion , although the unsafe online environment , spend too much time on internet may be the potential negative factors of using online social networks .
It is easier for people to approach the other after knowing the information .
There are many people in the social media with beautiful image and good content in their pages , however in real life , he or she may do not have jobs or live poorly .
Of course , some people may do it to make their futures slightly happier , however , the carrier , before the testing , can choose not to go for the test and simply live with unknowns and accept the facts .
People are able to share the culture or pretty photos online , therefore others can spread the joy with them .
They may do not want this truth to influence their life or want to keep it as a secret and do not others know about it .
In my opinion , as long as we keep our mind healthy and strong , we can fight any disease as they come to us when we are fragile and weak .
Firstly of all , social media can make it more convenient for people to make friends and contact each other .
If they spend too much time on these social media , it may cause some problems to their mental development .
People will know about whether they carry a disease on their genes after they have done the genetic test .
In addition , a woman testing positive for BRCA1 would be expected to allow her brother or sister to disclose such information to a niece or nephew rather than do it herself , although this may be further complicated by an individual 's response to risk information as they not want to know .
There is a situation where a family is having a dinner together in a restaurant but everybody is busy with their own gadget , posting picture in Facebook , updating status on Twitter , or even chatting with friends .
As we all know , genetic risk carriers are likely to pass the genetics to their family members .
People can also get to know their friends ' state and mood by looking at their posts on line .
Imagine you are living like a normal person but suddenly one day your relative comes tells you that actually there are some possibilities that you may encounter some disease in the future , what kind of feeling are you going to have ?
The communication is also not limited in words .
We should maximize the benefits of such platforms but be careful of its impacts on the actual life that we have .
Above all , life is more important than secret .
But there is possibility that the person on the other side is deceiving you in order to obtain your information against you .
However , there exits some disadvantages which will affect people in some degree .
Everything will be bad if we do n't know how to use them wisely no matter whether it is really good or not .
Nevertheless , it will depend on what kind of genetic diseases , given in the context of current medical technology .
It is also entire incorrect to fault social media alone for the lack of interpersonal skill .
In conclusion , the showing up of social media sites is a double edged sword .
It is just because that you do not become strong enough to overcome the hard time .
Do one who suffered from this disease keep it a secret of infrom their relatives ?
Therefore , I would agree to that it 's obligated for a carrier of known genetic risk to tell his or her relatives to avoid any family-related ethical dilemma that could be raise up in the future .
There also exists some probability of wrong testing .
The people with albinism have sensitive skin and it needs regular treatment .
Then they can have a healthy baby with the help of the doctors .
Secondly , the carrier of a known genetic risk may destroy the peace of a family even broken the relation between children with the adult .
I do think there is difference in it and I believe many of us will agree .
Ultimately , the best way to enhance interpersonal skills is still through face-to-face meetings but social media sites are only the tools to enhance it .
There is an element of seeking out for attention rather than expressing one 's true opinion on social networks .
Hence , it is essential to tell their family members about the risk of their genetic disorder both as a social responsibility and a favor to conserve the family basis .
Nevertheless , the advantages of social media will benefit the masses if the negative aspects of it can be carefully taken care of .
On social media , everyone is a broadcaster and a viewer .
However , calling a person by using a phone and writing a person a letter require some cost , and sending a letter to a person who live far away , especially in villages , takes much time .
Furthermore , living with a secret is not a good sensation , especially if the situations of other relatives become worse , you should feel guilty and depressed .
Firstly , interpersonal skills may be affacted by the reduction in face-to-face human contact .
Some scholars argue that the usage of social media reduces the face-to-face connection between human .
As the techonology has been advancing , it has reached a stage whereby the advancement triggers some ethical dilemmas in relation to the acutual use of the techonology .
However , if you tell the truth to your wife and relatives , you offer a chance about whether to have child or not .
The emotional depression that the carrier might get and the sense of guilty can be more than expected and could be a burden in mind for the rest of the life .
The reason why it is so addictive is , that the more people get into the social media , they seek attention from their friends .
Nowadays , the study in the genetic field has gone further and further due to the high-velocity technological advancement .
We can even know what a friend who leave thousands of miles away eat for lunch though these kinds of social media .
Firstly , social media brings convenience to the world .
However , this is not exactly true when other factors including psychological influence , social influence , are taken into consideration .
We know each others ' status , changements and so on through the social media .
Also , as numerous profit-driven companies realize the hugh human traffic on such social media sites , they make it as a pond to fish the customers by uploading many advertisements .
It may affect our daily lives and we will think about it every day .

Then they are unable to have a suitable method to protect themselves and emotional preparations .

Although not everyone is good at public relationship even without the existence of the social media sites , we can not deny that it do affect some people in their ability of interpersonal skills .
If there is no social media , it is difficult for people to know about a stranger .
When people around us know that we got certain disease , their altitudes will be easily changed , whether caring us too much or keeping away from us .
Although it helps to connect us with our friends wherever we are , it at the same time reduces the chance for us to talk to our friends face to face which may affect our interpersonal skills .

'Privacy ' , this is the word that popular in these few decades .

The importance of informing relatives of such genetic disease is vital as it may help to raise awareness and prevention towards the genetic disorder .
Teenagers are developing their interpersonal skills and social skills when they are growing up .
Every choice we have made may have a huge impact on their whole life .
Therefore , this article is written to explain the pros and cons of using social media in our daily life .
To the carrier himself of herself , he of she should have a feeling of resposiblity to tell his or her relatives their genetic disorder .
Tears showed nothing .
The images we choose to present are tentatively considered .
The society will adapt to such phenomenon as physical interaction are transformed into cyber interaction .
One might also choose to hint or encourage their certain relatives to run a gene test if they are concerned about negative consequences that comes across when they disclose their genetic results .
For people who are living very far from one another , the intensive use social media is justified .
As a result , it is important for people to know that we need to be cautious about the time we spend on these social media .
The long distance and time-consuming make spreading the messages very difficult at that time .
Recently , the rise of social media helped people to have more closer connection with each other , it is a more convenient and cheaper way to have online contact compared with face to face meetings .
There are about 50 % of the people who have learnt about breaking news from social media .
With current booming technology , it is agreeable that people become more technology-savvy and they want to spend more time interacting with each others through social media sites , however , it does not mean that we should neglect face-to-face human interaction as it plays even a more important aspect in our life .
For example , within a family , regardless of who had first received genetic information , parents were seen as having the primary responsibility to pass on information to any offspring , either adult at risk .
In addition , emotional preparations and the ways you explain your genetic condition is also important so that you can convey the correct information to your family and relatives and if necessary to guide them if he/she wish to conduct a similar genetic testing .
In addition , there are also chances for people to miscommunicate with each other as they can not sense the tone of the other party over social media platforms .
For example , breast cancer is a genetic disease and it can be cured if it is being realised in the early stage .
Thus I believe that social media sites are one of useful tool to help people known each other better .
The appearance of those social media sites causes those problems to be solved .
People do not have the ability to choose their gene , they should not be thought badly because of bad gene .
People get connected or closer with same preferences .
It is commonly seen in a food court or restaurant that a group of people sitting together around a table with each of them having a cell phone in their hands .
A strong mental condition and conviction must be build from within and from the closest ones .
This improves the connectivity between the users .
While we do know that we should not discriminate them based on their limitations , many people still do it with or without them realizing it .
It is just different .
These social media may be tools of their campaign and manipulating the thoughts of the public .
Last but not least , social media sites also link people together through allowing us to create our own groups , pages or sites to share our hobbies , interests and studies in particular subjects .
We used to send wishes cards during festive season like Chinese New Year , and we feel so good to write one and of course to receive one with stamps on it .
It is easier for people to accept it morally .
I think a carrier of a known genetic risk should not be obligated to tell his or her relatives .
It is better to let the other party know the fact than after the baby is born and certain type of genetic disease is found .
First and foremost , we should realize that social media world is not trustworthy and real .
It will make people spend more time on chatting on the internet rather than communicate face to face such that the interpersonal skill will be badly affected .
One of the advantages which are carried by those social media sites is that they can connect us more closely than before .
Especially when it is just a risk , the option is really his since he is not an actual sufferer .
If he chooses to live in the uncertainty that the gene holds and willing to accept it , he could do that , and it has been something that is 'normal ' to everyone in the past as gentic testing was not possible .
A known genetic risk can also affect our next generation critically .
Genectic testing is a personal decision , with the kowledge that there is a possiblity that one could be a carrier or not .
After he takes the test and be obliged to tell his relatives , everyone know that he is a carrier .
On the other hand , the viewers , are not the listeners .
However , it is also bringing some social changes whereby such virtual worlds are overtaking the real-life world , resulting in some negative impacts in individuaul 's daily lives and therefore becoming a large problem in societies as a whole .
Communication would have took a different turn without the easily available social media .
It is true that social media makes people be able to connect one another more conveniently .
The more we care about facebook , the less time we will have to spend with our friends .
Especially for the young people without marrige , if he/she is known to have some genetic risk , it may have certain chance that his/her child would carry the same disease , but not in certain .
Secondly , without the truly communication in the real life , people lose the ability to see the truth and false .
For more convenience , sentences are shortened to simply three or four words such as lol ( which means laugh intensively ) and " asap " ( which means as soon as possible ) .
By informing them , the carrier is never alone in fighting the battle of such disorder risk .
Some people may say that telling the truth may arise some unnecessary doubts and panics which will endanger the family harmony .
However , if they already know they have a gene that may make them have higher possibilities to get hypertention .
The decision to undergo genetic testing can only be made by the individual at risk for a disorder .
If the person tell their relatives that he or she carries a disease gene , his or her relatives can go to hospital to check whether they also get a disease gene .
However , in my opinion , it is the obligation of a carrier of a known genetic risk to tell his or her relatives about his or her actual situation .
Updated news people care about can be easily obtained when you refresh your social media sites on your smart phones and laptops almost every time at any time .
What is the basic difference between genetic disorder and other disorders .
The spreading of false information can be a potential psychological threat to everyone , given that social media can disseminate information in a realtively fast speed .
Moreover , people usually like to share boldly about their real feelings online with their masks in reality being taken off .
To put it in the nutshell , everything has its own pros and cons .
One of the examples is the 2012 riots happened in Egypt and Zambia .
On the other hand , others may think that it will be considerate to tell the relatives because the latter will have a higher tendency of getting the same genetic risk .
Besides that , company also can use the convenience of social media sites , such as Facebook chat or Skype to facilitate the meeting with parties of project from around the world .
Therefore , everytime when we use social media , we should take both sides into consideration and try to avoid be affected by the disadvantages .
They will consider whether to give a birth to a new baby because of this genetic problem and they will start finding ways to try to avoid their baby to carry this genetic risk as well .
Whether we are at home or at school , at work or on a holiday , we are able to communicate and interact with our friends .
Nothing is absolute right or wrong .
Focus on the negative side of the annouance of genetic risk first .
As they are so used to having an online avatar , they may lose their self-identity in real life and may not realise how to interact people in real-life .
With just a touch away from any meida/electronic devices , one can easily interact and communicate with his friends without much hassle .
Telephone may be perceived as a big innovation created ever when the first time Graham Bell introduced it .
For myself , I am long to some places after I saw those beatiful pictures taken by my firneds .
In conclusion , everything has two sides of stories .
Therefore , there is need to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of social media .
However , after one has registered in those social media sites which are not reliable , all the information you have filled in will be a weapon against you in the future .
For example , if an unmarried person has gene Aa and gene aa is sufficient for a very seriou disease .
To those family members who care about them , it is also a moral obligation .
Through those sites we are able to talk to them , to know what their activities are and who their friends are , etc. From the surface point of view it is no doubt that these sites help us to have a better relationship with our relatives despite of the distance .
First , for the case of marrige , people should be honest and tell his/her spouce they may carry certain genetic risk that may affect their offsprings .
Being in Asian society where genetic testing is not a common practice , I do think that it is the choice of the patient whether he or she wants to tell his or her relatives about his or her disease .
However , they behave quite boring when I talk to them in real life .
Therefore , while social media sites are undoubtedly have benefits in our life , we should consider its drawbacks and thus use it wisely so that we can gain more of their benefits and it disadvantages us in the smallest way as possible .
It is not the broadcasters themselves they care about , but the content .
In conclude , socia media benefits people in several ways but in the same time harms people .
Some people spend a lot of time in it and forget their real life .
Firstly , the carrier and his or her family can take precautions , physically by actions to reduce the chance of it being inherited to offspring and , mentally if the action fails to prevent it being inherited .
This is related to the interpersonal skill that is mentioned before , that can be decreasing qualitatively if we are used to facing gadget , not facing human being .
If the relatives carry that disease gene , they can share the experience with him or her and give some help , they will also teach him or her how to communicate with others about this issue .
Generally , the clinic or hospital will not tell the carrier 's families without the agreement of carrier .
Such patients are still emotionally volatile or they may be unaware of the consequences of such genetic disorder due to their young age .
The benefits of doing so are able to outweigh its disadvantages .
No matter it is a party , dinner or just simply get-together , there always are some people bow their head and playing their phones even their family and friends are in front of them .
We can not let it go .
On the other side , as stated above , a person who want to confirm and has been prepared to face the result can choose to do the genetic testing individually .
Other people then are influenced by us and tend to do the same .
When our phones are accidentally done , we can also use the social media to get contact with our friends .
Though because of this , social media is still a much fairer and more transparent online platform for the public to share ideas compared to other traditional medias .
A guy who is going travel for months can easily tell all of his friends about his activity .
A lot of fresh graduates can find jobs thanks to Facebook and Twitter .
This covenience can be percieved as almost in realtime .
After my Manager taught her mother how to use Facebook , she was able to upload video clips of her grandchild .
The results are disclosed to husbands and wifes .
The first one is the importance of being responsible for your self-wellness and health of your relatives and the second one is being responsible for the next generations .
Maybe after we tell them , they will go for it and know more about themselves .
There are a lot of disadvantages that people may not realize of .
This would avoid the rise of more family-related ethical dilemma .
First of all , it can be an alert for the family members of the patient and let them be aware of the possible disease that they may also have .
One advantage is that it is more convenience to contact others by social media .
For example , on Twitter , it is exciting to follow people that you adore like famous movie and series stars , business men and entrepreneurs .
Therefore , this advantage of social media sites saves money and time , and also provides convenience for many people .
There are advantages and disadvantages in using social media sites , however in this case striking balance between social media and lives is the most important thing to do .
And it becomes more convenient to obtain and update information by using social media .
There are always newspaper report that a new born baby has be abandoned at hospital after they realized the baby have diseases that need a huge amount of money to secure .
Without facebook , we may lost contact .
Moreover , the truth can not be hidden forever but when it is revealed , more shocking and upset it will be .
In my opinion , social media websides such as Twitter and Facebook will not affect the chance for people to have face to face contact and thus negatively affects interpersonal skills .
For example , we tend send a birthday wishes when Facebook promts us " Today is someone 's birthday " .
Hence , they should be the people be grateful for and the people we would like to share the joy together .
First , social media networks have a lot user base , it helps to link people from different parts of the world .
If I am interested in politics , I can just follow some politics newspapers or public figures .
At the same time , we are prepared to know when there are other members got this disease .
But , if there is trust and mutual understand on social media , it will be ideal for people to improve relationship and make new friends .
This allows friends that may not have the time for meet up to still connected in a way .
But overall , the advantages far outweigh its disadvantage .
From the legal aspect , the answer is no but from the ethical aspect , the answer should be yes .
In addition , privacy issue has become more popular nowadays since some people do not realize that they may actually share some information that they are not willing to share at the first place .
If certain disease genetic test is very accurate and it is unavoidable and necessary to get treatment and known by others , it is OK to disclose the result .
Lying on the bed for the remaining life , and even die immediately , these are the consequences which we can not imagine .
With the nature that the results will be known once the tests are done , each individual that is diagnosed to be a genetic risk carrier face an ethical problem : They should warn their relatives about the risking of being the same genetic risk carrier .
If there is no problem , that will be wonderful .
Some people who are try to talk in the public can also actively take part in the group chatting via social media .
We can know more news and cultures through socia medias .
It is immoral and impractical .
Firstly , what is the range of the relatives ?
However , critics may argue that not all information or news disseminated are reliable .
Twitter , that has more simplified function compared to Facebook , gives more benefit if used as information sharing media .
Nowadays , the advancement of technologies improves the life of many people a lot .
They need to ask for doctor 's advice before they plan to have a baby .
He may have different considerations other than due to the judging people or may result in making his family worry for nothing when thinking of whether he should tell it to his relatives , and no matter what choice he makes , we need to respect it and we have no right in saying that he must tell his relatives about it .
However,there are still people against the decision of revealing private information.As in the case of Alzheimer patients,it is up to the patient 's own choice to disclose information.However,research has shown that doctors have tried to interpret who,how and whom will Alzheimer disease be disclosed to minimise potential negative impact to families members ( DementiaToday,2012 ) .There are associations provide helps to Alzheimer patients like Alzheimer 's Association ( Alzheimer 's Association,1980 ) .Although there are still thousand of genetic risk diseases out there that might not be receiving all helps and supports from everyone,the needs to receive immediate understanding and support from family members is an utmost help that patients need in their difficult time .
Other than that , I believe that the stong bond we have with our family is the biggest pillar of support to the carrier .
Pepope do not know how to talk with others face to face , especially the strangers .
With the help of social media tools , we can stay in contact and keep ourselves up to date with our family and friends even though we are away from them .
An example that may serve as an illustration is breast cancer .
Thirdly , social media sites keep us up-to-date on latest news and updates from almost everywhere in the world , all with a click away on the refresh button .
In this modern world , the technologies were improved a lot compared with the last century .
I believe most of us have the experience of suddenly forget how to write a word that we should know .
However , social network helps people to meet and chat much more easier , they can even use video chat and create group chat to chat with multiple parties at the same time .
Some of the diseases may not show symptoms until the carrier is old enough .
In conclusion , everything has its two-sided affect and it depends on how we exploit it .
Personally I am study in oversea , busy study life keeps me away from contact my old friend .
Then wife D might tell her mother , who likes to gossip on her way to the theatre .
Nowadays , with the development of technology and society , social media become more popular and even important in our daily life .
Though social media do create relationships , relationships and friendships are only firm and real if people have gone through experiences and communication in face-to-face interaction .
Secondly , although social network takes time for people to chat online but not face to face , they may still decide a time online to meet others face to face in the daily life .
How can they not tell their loved ones who they really are and get their loved ones in danger ?
However , social media may do some harm to people 's life .
People can think while typing and prepare what they want to say but in face-to-face communication , every word that comes out of your mouth and may be not well arranged is the picture of your personality .
It is a concern that will be with us during our whole life , because we will never know when the ''potential bomb' ' will explode .
Everything we type in the social media sites is recorded in the server and then transfer to the companies for spying and advertising .
First of all , people saves money by using internet to contact other people and reading news .
As it is a genetic risk,the patient next-of-skin might have a high chance of carrying the risk,hence the need to inform their relatives is important so that necessary prevention actions could be taken before unforeseen circumstances might occur.For example,if you are the only child in a family and unfortunately,you are suffering from a genetic disease that the genetic trait might be passed on to your next generation if you have a child,hence by letting your family members aware of the situation,it would lessen family stresses and suffering on forcing you to settle down and have children.However , social ethic issues like discrimination and privacy are biggest concerns and potential barriers to enforce patients or doctors to disclose information to patients relatives.It challenges the confidentiality and privacy principles.Currently , under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 ( HIPAA ) in the United States,there is no legal obligation requirement to disclose information to relatives,it is up to the patient 's wish to disclose to their family members.Early disclosement to family members brings in positive reaction and prevention,as in the case of Angelina Jolie,she chose to disclose information and underwent treatment to reduce the risk of breast cancer significantly to under five percent.I still can recall her reason for disclosing her own story was that she does not want to live under the shadow of cancer .
Facebook and Twitter can serve as an alternative route to make connection between us and our old friends .
Social media also provides people huge brunch information about people and things that they interests .
You can share photos , videos and every meaningful experiences of your life .
One of Manager in my working place has the same situation .
It could rather be better for him or her this way .
Therefore , it is our responsibility to tell the relatives to prevent the occurrence of undesired consequences .
On the other side , we need to rethink about the influences brought by the social media .
People get certain disease because of genetic changes .
I get news for sales , clothes and cosmetics from my friends .
For example , on mother 's day , people are shy to say " I love you " to their mothers so they can type it on his or her mother 's facebook page .
The certainty of what is being shared or expressed could not be proven physically as media limits this physical interaction , except when using a webcam to chat .
Online friends became real life friends and real life friends communicate with one another online .
Sometimes a family with potential genetic disorder risk may not be able to detect the potential harm inside their bodies as none of their members reflect any observable disorder symptoms .
Social media sites are also a very useful tool for people to start a new friendship or relationship .
Not only the phone did the jobs for them , but also devices like personal computer , laptop , tablet , and many other devices which are able to connect to internet .
In the chat room , she created a close relationship with eight people .
As we all know , the interpersonal skills are essential for us to communicate with each other and to present our views and ideas .
If the disorder symptoms reflect on a kid , the parent will be informed by the medics for sure , then the whole family will stay alert to their bodies ' condition .
And if the results turn out to be otherwise , then the family can be prepared emotionally and psychologically of the future outcome and aid them in making upcoming decisions .
Sometimes it becomes extremely hard for them to accept this news especially if they are going to know that they or their descendants may have a severe disease like blood disease which is untreatable .
I am most inclined to believe that his or her relatives have the rights to know the result .
For example , diabetes is a kind of genetic disease .
In this case , if one of the family members or close relatives is found to carry genetic risk , it is better for the patient to tell his/her close relatives about the issue and let others known about the risk so that his/her familay members are able to perform some daily excesses to prevent the potential disease or they may go to hospital and check for the correspongding flows .
However wife D is not even under the risk of having this disease .
It is obvious that there will be better for one person to be worried than many .
Next , communication are also greatly improved .
Firstly , they have lost the courage to meet strangers , not even the courage to talk .
However , some people worry that social network can affect interpersonal skills as it reduces face-to-face human contact .
More and more illness are discovered to be related to some genes with the development of the medical technology .
All-in-all , it depends on individual and also the nature of the disease , but he or she should be obligated to inform the relatives if there are possibilities in curing or preventing it .
Surrounded by such concerns , it is very likely that we are distracted to worry about these problems .
Furthermore the act of informing others without the consent from their parents or the patients itself could harm the psychological state of the affected family .
Hypertension can be caused by genetic problems which make the carrier harder to digest the fat and salt in blood which can cause hypertension .
Many people in our society are not well informed about many genetic diseases and many of them will most likely to judge or at least differentiate those who have genetic diseases since they feel that the patients are abnormal or 'weird' .
If the wife had not hind the truth and asked for doctor 's advice before they have baby , the tragic would not happen .
The basis of a family is that everyone trusts and love each other with no doubts .
Genetic risk does carry its consequences and should not be taken lightly within the family circle .
Therefore , telling the relatives about the situation may avoid a lot of trouble in this way and save much time for proper treatment .
As the case of health issue is related to genetic risk , with keyword on " genetic " which highlights the risk of passing down the disorder to the next generation .
In my opinion , the patients , which are carriers of some known genetic risk are supposed to share the truth with their family members .
Genetic testing has become a beneficial way to predict and protect each individual at risk for a disorder .
In addition , social network site can help you keep in touch with friends living very far away .
However , there are many problems againt the execution of asking a carrier to tell his or her ralatives the cause of his or her diseases .
For the countries like Singapore , they are short of manpower to contribute to the nation .
Today world is considered to be the era of social media sites like Facebook and Twitter which are attractively connecting people around the world .
That shows how actually news and information can be shared easily through social media .
The inclusion of intimate presence and relative touch could also bring a better rapport between those interacting .
In conclusion , I think social media has reshaped interpersonal relationships from a more human-based friendship that requires sharing and caring between friends , to a more information-based friendship that requires a mutual interest .
He can even talk to her daughter face-to-face using video call via internet .
With regard to this choice given , there must be some rules to regulate and exercise personal freedom of decision making .
However , not everybody is so lucky that they can make sure they do not carry any disease genes .
Without trust and love , there is no difference between a family and a bunch of strangers living together .
It also brings many negative effects such as loss of face-to-face communicating skills which is important in their working place .
This means both of his parents has gene A and they are both under high risk of having disease C. They could save the cost of runing two separate tests to see whether they are under high risk of having disease C. If he runs a test and know that he has the gene Aa .
Not only the child but also the entirely family will suffer .
As many people realize , a genetic disorder can be related to the carrier 's relatives , that is , one of the family members is at risk for a genetic disorder means that other family members also have almost the equally risk to have it , so this problem should be treated seriously by the family .
If your genetic results indicate that you have gene changes associated with an increased risk of heart disease , it does not mean that you definitely will develop heart disease .
In conclusion , in order to avoid the family-related ethical dilemma , it is best for any carrier of known genetic risk to inform his/her relatives .
Having to meet and interact for talks allows one to be closer to the recepient .
Let 's examine the advantages and disadvantages of using social media in our daily life and society .
Although emocons can be used to show certain emotion , this differs from the real authentic emotion of your friends when you observed them through their body language and their facial expression .
It is a long time discussion that whether a carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to tell his or her relatives that his or her disease is caused by gene .
As for the advantages , there are two aspects : more convenient to contact others , easier to know about others .
Many advantages are given to the users .
As the result , it is in the interests of the carriers and their relatives , telling the genetic testing result is needed .
Tell them or keep this secret until we die ?
We should keep in mind that there are still ways for us to contact with our family or friends .
Secondly , annouance the potential risk would cause the family member to be scared of this certain issue , although the factor would not be that serious , people would still fear that they would have some potential disease in the future thus go to hospital and do additional check or take more medicine in order to prevent the disease , and this creats unnecessary costs to the family .
People should avoid the misuse of socia media and use it in the proper way .
And we keep track of all family members health conditions .
As a result , the family generation stops by the moment the adult carrier announces his issue .
Advantages and Disadvantages of Using Social Media in Our Daily life and Society .
Thirdly , some diseases are not noticeable and may lead to serious health problems .
Finding old friends through Facebook , for example , is more easier than asking people around in real life .
When people want to check whether they are genetic risk carriers , they can go and approach a doctor to consult about it .
This competitive world is cruel to those are not able to survive .
As explained above , modern and sophisticated technology does n't always give advantages .
In the end , I believe that the support in terms of mental or even monetary from your family could help the carrier to fight against the genetic disease .
There is a story I watched on TV .
So for the consideration for the other family members , the relatives should be informed .
However , critics may argue that with the existence of social media sites have reduced physical human interactions among people as they will prefer sitting in front of a computer to going out and meeting new friends .
Awareness of having a genetic disorder may help in diagnosing a genetic disorder for a person , and therefore , this may make the prevention of a certain disorder possible .
Human has their own rights and privacy .
Secondly , social network may leak certain personal informations to the public , as the cyber environment is not perfect and not safe , people may not protect their privacy online effectively and sometimes , some people may use others personal information to deceive .
As a result , social media helps them do the jobs but indirectly affects their interpersonal skills .
In conclusion , it will be considerate to inform the risk of getting the same genetic disease to the relatives .
Nowadays , thanks to the help of social media , with just one click , you can contact your family and friends wherever you want .
For a carrier of genetic disorder to know the fact that he or she is a carrier , it causes more dilemma rather than getting the disorder .
For those who lives within the community should at least meet up , and not use social media as the primary source of communcation with each other .
Then nobody wants to marry A , or his relatives .
And at the same time , improves the interpersonal skill , through dynamic practises betwwen individuals and realtime presence .
And now I got over 500 friends on Facebook and buried myself with hundrends of seeds every day .
If the wrong testing was not found by the doctor , the family and the children may be sad and have a struggling life for their whole life .
As a result , if the situation keep go on in this unexpected trend , it will cause a bad effect on the young generation .
Regardlessly , if the disorder is rarely to be fatal , or it does not caused any inconvenience to the carrier , revealing the truth is always the right thing to do .
Intensive use of Social media does reduce the time people spend in face-to-face communication .
In my opinion , every individual has to take responsibility of their own lives by making a right decision .
This piece of information does play a role in family planning matters , therefore although no one is obliged to tell about their genetic risk to anyone , it should be encouraged to tell it to their future partner .
Thus , having the knowledge that such genetic disorder is benign would be beneficial towards their emotinal thoughts .
At the same time , there will also be chances that the genetic test result is not correct which means they are actually wasting their lives worrying about this thing , so actually we are bringing trouble to them .
Without the facial impression , it is easier to misunderstand the intention of speakers .
Let us take example from Facebook and Twitter , two of the most famous social media sites .
However , there are also a great amount of people who against this technology .
On the one hand , it can tell members of the carrier 's family the possible disease they may have and can perform treatment in time if possible .
This becomes a huge problem when they have no choice but have to face things in real life .
On the other hand , without knowing any genetic disorder and accepting the fact , the family will stay positive and work together to overcome the diability .
Through Facebook , peope are able to maintain relationship with their old acquaintances .
Keeping the Secret of Genetic Testing
If the knowledge of the genetic risk was to be shared within the family or relatives , there might have chances for them to have it in their blood , which they may do necessary precautions to prevent .
It could possibly causes a problem in a family due to the fact and creates more unhappiness int the family .
The next point is that telling relatives can raise their awareness of having the similar genetic disorder , preventing certain genetic disorders to affect themselves .
Some may share fewer and fewer time with their family and not knowing how to express themselves .
Therefore my Manager would not miss the moments of her daughter 's growth .
And of course , he or she will think of not having any child after getting married , and the same thought goes to the cousins as well .
The social network may also creat some negative impacts for the people .
Within clicks , we could check on the friend 's profile and read on for his/her updates .
The idea of searching for democracy is passed from Egyptians to people in Zambia quickly through the use of social media .
What 's more , various of cultures can be shown to us through social medias .
Secondly , social media network opens the door of opportunities for people due to its great benefit in connecting .
It saves a lot of money and time as well as strengthen our relationship although we stay at different places around the world .
If the result turned out something that the carrier can not accept then it would have been better not knowing the truth .
Large numbers of patients with the genetic risk would want to keep it as a secret as the genetic risk may indicates their high chance to carry certain disease .
Many of the teenagers today claimed that they are able to keep in touch with their friends through social media , regardless of their location .
It is the ethic of staff in hospital to keep the secret of any patients .
Hence , for a family in which every member is truly believing in each other and loving each other ,all these troubles are just testaments to make them stronger .
I find that it is important to inform especially if it is contagious , the carrier could prevent the disease from spreading out to the society .
While most people agree that each individual has his own right to decide whether to undergo a genetic test or not , they have different stands in whether it is the patient 's responsibility or freedom to share the result with his or her relatives .
In addition , with all those " nice " guys around on the social network website , one may neglect people surrounding him or her but just communicate with friends on facebook .
It is quite significant especially for those young teenagers since they would rather go to these sites to see the news and know what happened in this world than read the newspaper every day .
Nobody can deny social media 's advantages as the benefit it provides in connecting people regardless of nationalities , races , cultures and languages .
Then eventually , she discovered that eight people became one as he was using eight different identities to chat with her all the time .
In the view of my point , a carrier of a known genetic risk should not be obligated to tell his or her relatives , with the support of the following reasons .
Therefore , I think a known genetic risk should not be obligated to tell his or her family or relatives without the person 's permission .
However , there rises a family-related ethical dilemma if it is right to tell a carrier 's family once the test has been conducted and the results are known .
In China , the older generation with traditional culture background , will always think of having more children as well as grandchildren , to make the family liven up and stronger .
To put it in the nutshell , I believe that people should have the obligation to tell their relatives about the genetic testing result for the good of their health .
Thus , advice from hospital plays the important role for this .
Gone were the times , and now we do mass sending and the receiver may feel less meaning in such online wishes .
Genetic testing is a personal choice .
People connecting through the social media sites can spend no money on the communication , and also take only one or a few seconds for the message to reach .
Some of them may have changed their phone numbers and addresses , and we are not able to find them through a phone or a letter .
The users of every social media sites need to strike a balance between the real world versus the virtual one .
They can become anyone .
In this case , the carrier can eat less candies and chocolates to prevent intake to much sugars , and at the same time , if the carrier tell this information to the relatives , it will be useful for them to know that they may have diabetes in the future becouse of related genes and they can perform the same exercise to intake less sugar to prevent the disease .
One of the diseases is sickle cell trait .
Once people 's genetic information is told to other people .
However , the social media sites truly reduce the communication in face-to-face which truly affects interpersonal skills .
These social media serves a purpose to bind people in spite of their geographical boundaries but it does n't mean that surrounding people are neglected as the payoff .
Another disadvantage that affects other people is that by only showing selected part of our lives , we build " false image " in public .
Many people may support with a theory that every people have their right to enjoy the world , especially people with religions .
For an example , one is able to send notifications and other information we use to have them in hardcopy previously , over the web and the process takes seconds .
I believe that some of the carriers will choose to not reveal their disease to the family members as they do not want to make their family members worry and feel uncomfortable or even feel ostracized by them .
While social media brings convenience to people life , people are more and more willing to use social media for chatting instead of face-to-face chatting which has a time and place requirement .
As for those in your family who are more likely to be affected , they can go to the hospital to do the checks regularly .
Thank to those social media , the communication among people all over the world is possible and can be done with ease .
Secondly , people 's over-addition may avoidably , to some degree , exacerbate social alienation , and this kind of alienation causes some social media users to suffer from the over-dependence of virtual social networking .
No pledge of authenticity risks people 's information and privacy that are shared on social media sites .
Several arguments have been made regarding the social media actually have some inevitable disadvantages to people .
Here I want to share Forest'view on this issue .
" This issue has been discussed for a long time .
However , many of the carriers are not strong enough to overcome the challenges oneself .
A group of friends having high tea in a caf é without chatting as well , because they do not know what to talk but pressing on their display screen .
A good law should be clear and easy to execute .
The children rely the parent to live .
Whereas , it can also make people forget to communicate to their family and friends in the real life and affect negatively to their interpersonal skills .
However , there is still a diversity of point of views among the people .
The relation between parents and children is something about love and dedication .
Thus , the lack of face-to-face human contact through social media restricts actual interaction which can be stimulated through the media .
However , it seems that , especially for some those , sharing some parts of their lives such as videos and photos on the social media sites become really necessary .
However , in order for people to maintain their relationship as well as making new friends , it requires mutual trust and understanding between both parties .
Lastly , it is easy for people to waste a lot of time using social media .
However , its disadvantages also can not be ingnored when you cosider it as a platform to show off and a stage for cyber crime .
Nowadays , people not only pursuit the comfort of their own life but also a better development of their following generations .
However , if you have undergone and known that you are a carrier , you are responsible for your whole family .
On the other hand , if there are ways can help us to control or cure the disease , we can going through thses process from the scope of the whole family .
Some said that the genetic risk that is found in a person should be kept secret because it is considered as a personal information which should be kept confidential .
Hence , with the knowledge of having genetic risk , the relatives of this genetic disease will do a medical check-up , which might save them in realising it at a earlier stage .
In the past , vast communication are done by one of the many such a telegram , snail mail and poor-quality voice calls .
In conclusion , social media in the contemporary society is able to help one improve relationship and make new friends , as well as , disseminate information efficiently to the masses .
Personally I feel that we still should take our responsibility to tell them the situation .
social games ) which allow users to communicate with remote people , and also to update and express themselves at the same time .
However , it leads to a new problem that " should a carrier of a known genetic risk be obligated to tell his or her relatives ?
Distance and time are no longer the problems , which is convenient especially when instant chat is needed .
This lowers the experience of human ability to interact with one another which can adversely shape one 's behaviour .
As a result , they will lose eyes to contact and hands to express their feeling to people nearby them , which means they have lost the tools they need for face-to-face contact communicating .
What 's more , these days social media plays an important role in spreading the information .
Not only that , new friends can be easily met through such online platforms .
On the other hand , there are also problems with the population of the social media .
When we are diagonosed out with certain genetic disease , are we suppose to disclose this result to our relatives ?
Today , social media sites , such as Facebook and Twitter , are relatively common within the contemporary society ; and , people can communicate with each other , online or offline , on these social networking platforms .
Whose duty it is to inform at risk relatives or not greatly depends on the personal moral and the nature of how 'directive ' the risk is to them .
Nowadays , people can even use their phone to read news and everyone can be the first witnesses of what is happening in the world .
Thanks to them , people can get to know one another online , without having to travel to meet up for business purposes for companies or personal reasons .
Or in a less extreme case , the child may be disabled .
In the past , people used to writing letters to their friends and it will take relatively long time to send the letter over .
Genetic disorder inheritance is generation by generation , but not all of the offsprings show the relevant symptoms .
In my opinion , the responsibility of telling family and relatives is quite obvious .
However , is it the same when we keep in touch with someone virtually compared to when we meet them personally ?
In this fast pace and competitive world , people may not able to keep in touch with others .
Most people care about their relatives , if there is no serious consequence of telling them so , I assume most of them will tell their relatives to be careful .
Unlike just keeping contact numbers that we may not even call , social media like facebook is a great way for friends from different field or even from different parts of the world to be connected .
Every family member has their human right to know what is going on with them .
Social media does have some other advantages beside their general benefits to human being .
Although sometimes those genuine sharing of information may be inappropriate or even harmful , such as prevalent using of vulgarity and harsh-meaning comments , we can minimize those repercussions through strict regulations of content online .
On the other hand , when the teenager is studying in a foreign country , the internet is the only way that he can communicate with their parents and friends .
In conclusion , the use of social media has more advantages than disadvantages to our daily lifes .
If your wife is not aware of the truth and give birth to the baby , it will be possible for your child to carry the same genetic risk as well .
With the sharing of personal photos , posting of status of one 's personal feeling or experience and able to reply to these posts allowed human interaction to be engage and expand with ease .
Despite the luxury that is offered by social media , there are also harmful side effects which people may not realize it beforehand .
In addition , the genetic risk carrier would be showered with moral and emotional support from their relatives if it is been made known to them .
Another advantage of social media is in aiding the spread of democracy .
With the wide spread of advanced technology , social media sites are becoming more and more popular .
However , there are arguments that social media life brings in a reduction in face-to-face human contact , which in turn affects interpersonal skills .
They may not able to enjoy a normal people can enjoy .
A research shows that people will unconsciously hide his or her real thought when he or her say or post something that will be exposed to the public .
Everything comes with benefits will also have their disadvantages .
Whenever they need to use social media , they have to use a phone or internet .
They are just scrolling down pages of pages of pictures and statuses and see one of them which they might think it funny .
Social media sites ' role in connecting people around the world is undeniable .
They should let their spouse know about his or her situation before marriage .
Aside from hearing the voice , a webcamera could also be affixed to emulate a 'real ' interaction with expressions and gestures .
Therefore I believe the parents have their right to know the healthiness of their child .
Some say that it is a necessary step for human revolution .
Without the support of loved ones , patients ' life is no better than death .
What is genetic risk ?
Furthermore , with the current technology , smartphones are able to get access to social media sites which have made easier for consumers to use .
Secondly , it helps people to keep in-touch with one another .
As the development of the technology , social media becomes more and more significant role in the whole world .
The appearance of social media sites truly connects people closely .
Thus , the new technology will be able to bring a prosperous future for our and next generation .
It is our responsibility to identify the advantages and disadvantages of social media sites .
There are three reasons as follows .
However , the friendship on such virtual world is so superficial which is not so relevant to the real-life .
Nowadays , social media are able to disseminate information faster than any other media .
This is an issue need to be addressed as family-related ethical dilemma is involved .
Therefore , people may not contact with the faraway friends and relatives unless there are something important .
Introverts or those who are shy to communicate with their friends are now able to do so in the form of words via social media platform .
The convenience is beyond description .
Hence , it is undeniable that these sites play an important role in our global inter-connected world .
Therefore their son was inherited the genetic disease .
There might be false information or hoaxes spreading around on social media .
The profile picture may not be the person who that user says he or she really is .
To sum up , social media has advantages and disadvantages in people 's daily life .
This is especially to people who are overseas .
However , as we then tend to spend too much time on this and have significantly reduced in face-to-face human contact , that eventually affects our interpersonal skills .
Undeniable , it becomes more addicting when we spend more time busy socialising and interacting virtually .
In the sophisticated era like these days , experts keep producing inventions that are meant to make life easier .
I personally think this ist he right purpose of going through the genetic testing , so that a family who can not afford to have a disabled kid do not have to give birth to their child and make the entire family suffer .
Social media is becoming more important and we need to think more to make it serve us better and better .
Furthermore , you are also being responsible for your next generations by telling the truth that you are a carrier of a genetic risk .
In addition , doctors usually quote a statement , " Prevention is better than curation " ; this gives us an idea that preventing a disorder to happen has far more advantages than curing it .
It makes people feel extreme close to their admirers ' lives and works .
It consists of the function of connecting , sharing , interacting and advertising .
For instance , John is informed by his doctor that he is at risk for a genetic disorder but he does not tell his sibling , James about this .
Genetic testing has been made possible- it has become easy to tell if one is a carrier of a known genetic risk through genetic testing .
And also , we get a chance to talk to public people like popular stars and know their life better .
This information may not be known by the mother if she does n't tell her relatives regarding her condition .
That is true and of course it is the obligation of a family member to protect and take care of the family .
Howard Garner mentioned that the different intelligences can be charted , in accordance of utilising tests , and ranked .
However , the problem is , will the people really enjoy their life if they have to stay at hospital everyday and with all the needles and endless pain ?
We can not deny that the social media sites truly make the old friends do not lose the information and the chances to communicate with you even you are in a different country .
However , the wife actually had already known about the polygenetic disorder before the marriage and she did not tell her husband .
In conclusion,the state should have passed a legal bill to measure and provide information to doctors that till which extend should a doctor opt to reveal to relatives members about the genetic disease and in which situations it is open to patient 's decision.In addition,the state could also encourage to create assistance schemes to aid necessary help to needy patients to encourage them to open up for the benefit of own and family members.Although it may face challenges from social ethic issues,in a long term,with appropriate encouragement and aid from the government,more individuals would have a different view of acceptance and take appropriate measurements to protect their own health and their loved ones .
Usually people are not aware if they carry the sickle cell gene and this may lead to circulatory problem such as blood blocking .
If one such relative is told that he or she may have higher risk of getting sick , he or she may have be scared about the unknown life , partners , spouse and colleagues may choose to leave , and many other situations may happen which means the relative 's life may be ruined .
Many people many argue that setting the obligation may help more people , who are the relatives of the carriers , save their lives with a larger opportunity because of the early diagnosis .
Furthermore , not everyone on the social media sites is honest .
For example , if you find out one of your friend 's favourite singer is Justin Biber through facebook , you can give him or her Justin Biber 's new album or concert ticket as a birthday gift .
Using text-messaging language as an informal way of communicating on social media network also brings in a bad impact for us in a long term .
In my opinion , the carrier should tell his or her relatives about it .
This is reasonable since the exposure of the truth of being a carrier may make them be discriminated or sympothized by others which is not positive factors brought to their life .
Or else , if he holds back the genetic risk , they may have a unhealthy baby and may cause the death of the baby or end of their marriage .
We should take the advantages of the creatures we create and try to avoid the negative effects .
During that period , if one of the family member reflects genetic disorder symptoms , he will fell in an ethical dilenma for sure .
Nowadays , with the advancement of technology , it is easy to do a genetic testing .
Genetic testing is made possible and available for one 's decision to undergo .
As a result , it could affect their lives and studies .
However , it will become a controversial issue as it becomes a dilemma for a carrier of a known genetic risk to inform his or her relatives .
Therefore , the decision to inform relatives of such genetic disorder will be dependent of the situation and backgroung of the affected family , with the liberty of choice given to them in making the decision of informing others .
We communicate with others using social media , such as twitter , facebook and microblog more and more frequently .
In Singapore , many Malaysian cross the sea to work here .
In conclude , people should think carefully of what is the consequences of telling the relatives his or her generic disorder issue .
This is applicable to these social media sites .
He has to choose whether to protect his family or make his family more prosperity with a potential generic risk .
Furthermore , as it is a genetic problem , it will be better for the carrier to inform his or her family as other family member might experience the same thing .
This is because many relate genetic diseases to those such as Bubble-Boy disease , autism or down-syndrome .
Social media helps to lessen the hassle of geographical distance and brings people closer .
Therefore , for an effective and efficient society , there is a need to have a balance of both social media interaction and face-to-face human interaction within its people .
As stated above , I strongly believe that if we can use social media wisely rather than abusing it , we will all live a better life .
It is because a carrier with bad gene may not necessary have those genetic disease , if they can have coresponding healthy lifestyle before the age that the gene 's function become stronger .
Above all , social network site is like a two sided knife and people can only take good advantage of it by avoiding the possible disadvantages of it such as put less personal information on his or her facebook page .
Everyone can easily make up the personality and characteristics they want .
The disadvantages of social network media are quite undeniable .
In the past , it took a few days to receive a message as we need to post our letter and now , we can use e-mail which stands for electronic message to send messages to our friends or even use our handphone to send our messages .
This results in lack of interpersonal skills in individual , especially young students as they always have option to turn their back to the real-life and go online .
All users ' needs are an internet connection and an email account so that everyone can have a Facebook or Twitter ID to start their journey in social media life .
Social media sites suppose be a very useful and convenient tool to use and bring people get closer in this globalised world .
Apart from the ease of communication despite of the distance , many other advantages such as knowledge sharing and trades can be done through social media as well .
How do social media help change our lives ?
People used to write letters and send post cards to keep in touch with ones live far away from them in the past .
The issue on right to know or not to know is highly debatable although it is a genetic risk , one can not be entire sure because the genetic information could possibly result from the families of either parents - his maternal and paternal uncles , aunts or cousin .
The law 's spirit also include the fairness .
Twitter only allow users to give update that is limited to short sentences in order to spread the words fast , that only highlighted messages are delivered .
Interpersonal skills , like any other skills requires practice .
My answer is no .
From a practitioner 's perspective these findings are important because if lay constructs of the family and kinship are a social construct they may not be in line with geneticists ' views of family relationships , or about which blood ( or non-blood ) relatives should be informed and by whom ; this is also likely to be dependent on the cultural and ethnic context .
If a gene runs in the family , one of the family member test positive , whom does he need to tell .
When their children become teenagers , a lot of social problems may arise .
In fact , we may have just forgotten our friend 's birthday .
In addition , it is impractical to make such a law .
Secondly , genetic disease has a close relationship with the born gene together with their daily habits .
It means that one can not know another 's real thought and personalities by reading things that he or she put on social network media .
Nowadays , with the advancement of technology , it is easy to communicate wherever you are .
Though social media need not be necessarily bad , it must be used accordingly - for work , family , friends .
With the huge amount of cost savings , this capital can be utilized in the other sectors which benefits company more and boost up the company 's profit .
For example , if a carrier is told that he/she has the risk to have diabetes .
This will lead to a bad inter-personal skill as well as a problem of trusts .
Firstly , the social media sites can connect people with their friends and parents closely .
Firstly , someone having what kinds of disease belongs to his or her privacy .
Besides that , these skills requires time to develop and adapted .
In addition , there are also some false reports and fake IDs occur on both social media sites that people use fake ID to insult or harass someone , like the case of Heather Chua occurred recently on Facebook .
It is a method that benefits two parties which is a win-win situation .
I believe that most of us agree with these terms .
That is the most essential elements to overcome the challenges .
Substantial cost is saved without the tiring travel from one point to another point .
Overall , I belive that it entirely depends on the carrier to share the hard facts and face it with relatives but he has no obligation to tell still .
And so , he would have chosen not to undergo generic disorder testing and let the truth be mined forever .
First of all , from the angle of human right , a genetic risk carrier should not be obligated to tell the truth to others .
On the other hand , with the help of social media , some homeless people or someone who need the money to cure the disease can get the help from the world quickly because once one person know the information , his or her will share it to their " friends area " , then many people will know it and spread the information to the person who can give help .
As a result , people think of theirselves lowly and may lead to depression and mental disorder .
This essay will discuss about both the benefits and down sides of using social media in the contemporary society .
"
People around the world could easily share their thoughts about their governments .
Social media enables people from different parts of the world to communicate with one another .
The usage of social media sites indirectly causes a reduction in face-to-face human communication in real life , which will in turn cause the lost of interpersonal skills for many people .
They are too busy with their way too many virtual friends and some of them neglect the feelings of their real-life friends .
But they are all from one family and own the same forefather , then of course they own the same genes in some part .
The auto correction software is so effective when using electronic device until we did not realize the importance of writing .
For example , does the carrier only need to tell his or her direct relatives like parents and brothers and sisters or does he also need to tell relatives like his grandmother 's sister 's son 's daughter 's nephew ?
Thus , this makes Twitter and Facebook become one of the medium that we need .
Nevertheless,everything in life has positive and negative effects .
If all efforts have been made but the children still suffer from the syndrome then the family have to accept this fact and do whatever they can to bring a good environment for their children 's growth .
If they do not want to think too much of it and view it as a trouble , they may just ignore the possibility .
Therefore , telling the families and the relatives to get prepared for fighting the disease and even prevent to get the disease is your responsibility .
However , thanks to facebook , I can still keep in touch with them and I know what they are doing recently as we living close to each other .
Even though you can not eliminate the risk completely , you can at least try to be alert to avoiding getting the disease .
In a nutshell , a carrier of a known genetic risk should have their own right to decide whether to tell their relatives or not .
By doing so , less of his or her beloved ones will suffer from the genetic problem .
These sites play the role of connecting people around the world .
Some family may feel hurt , with regards to their family pride or reputation , on having the knowledge of such genetic disorder running in their family .
We can not deny that the genetic testing really helps people a lot when they face the disorder problem .
Teenagers may believe these people and easily be cheat and lose money even their safe .
While millions of users are connect at any one time , any information can be readily available at their perusal .
When they grow up , they take care of the old parents and thank for their dedication .
On contrary , if the carrier is an adult , who has his own choice to choose whether to inform his or her relatives about the risk , that will be more complex .
On the other hand , if the genetic risk is kept as a secret , although it may benefit the carrier to a certain extend and help to keep the privacy , but it has much larger negative impacts to the family members and relatives .
No more worries about the time it takes to deliver letters and packages .
In fact , I strongly think that the carrier should weigh both the positive and negative consequences of taking the genetic testing and tak an appropriate action to the results .
Parents and relatives have to work longer than expected and endlessly to foster their child if he/she is not able to foster himself/herself .
The lack of exposure to real life interaction with humans with not create the confidence and skills needed for one to interact seamlessly and effectively with others .
Recent research has shown that the more people spend time on social media sites , the less they become ambitious .
From the above two points of view I think social media could forge more interest-based friendships .
In conclusion , we could tell the benefits of telling genetic risk to the carriers relatives overweights the costs .
But , if it is a terminal disease as a genetic disease , most of the relatives will be disheartened upon having the knowledge about it .
In business area , social media is a good tool to develop and advertise products and services .
Most patients will be depressed after realising his or her conditions .
We all know that life is priceless and we have no right to judge a person 's death .
Therefore , it would be better for the carrier to be obligated to tell the information to the relatives , in order to let them know and prevent the potential disease through daily exercises .
It is weird that people sit around the table but all face to their phones and do not talk with each other .
If the genetic risk carrier is a minor or a child , then most likely the decision of informing the relative should be made with the consideration of the patients parents or legal guardian .
By making sure that they are aware of this genetic problem , they could have a full check-up for themselves and it will be better if they could even prevent it from happening to themselves .
I know it will have a huge impact on them , but we should know that they are our loved ones , we need to tell them and help them .
A couple in China have a son of 5 years old .
Last but not least , social media does affect human interpersonal skills when people increase the time on social sites and reject chances to expose to social daily life activities as well as interacting with people .
Although some people feel that an individual who is found to carry a dominant gene for Huntington 's disease has an ethical obligation to disclose that fact to his or her siblings , there currently is no legal requirement to do so .
Without their concern and support , we are hard to stay until this time .
One of the reasons why is because as a carrier , she or he needs a mental support to go through with this situation .
This had caused panic among the people who had flooded the local police department with numerous phone calls , and this had resulted temporarily closed of schools .
However , hospital can provide a councilor to advice the carrier about the action can be taken .
As citizens of a nation , they have the responsibility to support their country in many ways .
More and more networking has been transferred to internet from real life .
These social media makes people 's life much more colorful and provide a lot of fun .
They can build a daily habit to eat less salt and fat and thus to avoid hypertension .
If used for a good purpose , it can prevent unnecessary unhappiness , however , it could also make situation worse by revealing who the carrier is , in the family .
However , if a dignosed carrier is obligated to tell his or her relatives , the relatives will be forced to know their higher chance of being genetic risk carriers .
It can make our life simpler .
This will then could lead to stress as these students are not able to cope with their studies because they were distracted .
If phone and letter are the only way to contact them , we would probably not able to find them .
In the age of rapid technological advancement , a lot of medical breakthroughs are made possible .
Therefore , the social media is not safe which is bad to teenager 's future development .
It is still early for parents to decide whether they can foster a new life that are not able to work and may suffer the pain in the entire life .
The obvious disadvantage of using social media is that the time reduction on face-to-face contact .
As I mentioned in the beginning , there is also disadvantages of social media tools .
Also they can prevent the disease going to their offspring .
Furthermore , since it is the person 's gene that is affected , he has the right to determine with whom he wants to share the information with .
More people ( relatives ) know her problem , more information channel is provided .
However , this can also be achieved from personal choice .
While every family need to go through this or that kind of troublesome situations , the more troubles that a family has gone through together , the greater bond will be established between the family members as well as the greater amount of trust , love and understanding .
We may meet only once but we exchange our contact numbers as well as facebook account in order to keep in touch .
This will result in unnecessary conflicts between two parties over miscommunication .
As more and more social websites such as Twitter , Facebook and Weibo which have become ubiquitous , seamless and imperative in our life , people may worry about the young generation having problems in face-to-face communication skills .
Some genetic gene will pass only to boys rather than girls , some are on the contrary .
In the days without the social networks , people may not have the chance to know others from different countries or the ones they never meet before .
There should not be forced or obligied to do so , as it may negatively and drastically affect the emotions of the genetic risk carrier .
And in my opinion , this seems to be the main purpose of undergoing that genetic testing at the first place .
It is better for both parties to be honest .
They may collect information about that person by asking his friends , colleagues or family members .
That is because we are acting who we are in reality while we have no reason to do that in the online virtual world .
One of the reasons that the parents should be informed is that they have to decide whether they are capable to raise a child with genetic risk .
There may be possibilities when both the husband and wife are carriers and therefore they should not have any child since their child may not be able to survive even after they are born .
Since ancient times , human interact with others face by face .
Fourthly , it is important for the parents to give mental boost for their children with genetic disorder .
The notion of authority also extended 'vertically' .
With more convinient and humanian communications , the relationship between government and people get largely improved .
The question is whether a carrier of a known genetic risk should tell his or her relatives .
If the parents know that one of them is a carrier and disclose the information to their relatives then they can bring their children to undergo genetic testing and do n't need to be shy of it because it is for the sake of their children 's health .
With the willing of people to become the best among others , social network site now become a place to show off .
We may in actual fact communicating with a hoax Facebook acccount of a cyber friend , which we assume to be real but in reality , it is a fake account .
People that living in the modern world really can not live without the social media sites like Twitter and Facebook .
However , from the ethical point of view .
For Facebook , a comprehensive way of sharing is offered since multiple photos and videos can be uploaded , long notes can be published , even documents and data can be shared through Facebook nowadays .
Some may even do something wrong .
And if you still decide to have the baby , since the technology has been developed so advanced , it might be possible in the future that the application of altering gene is perfected and widely used , you can then choose to give birth to babies by giving them a brighter future .
There are advantages and disadvantages in itself , however , whether it is good or bad we are still not sure .
There are more intangible advantages that could support the stand of informing the relatives once the results are known after the test conducted .
There may be some people who say that it is necessary to tell the family members about the risk since some of them may be affected , while I do think that this view has a point , how much you can trust your family regarding this issue may also be a case .
The reason might just be that he or she just wants to " decorate " his or her face .
With the families ' support , there must be more energy to fight against with the demon .
There are still many disadvantages of using social media .
This might be beneficial for his future if he is aware of the risk of having this disorder .
More importantly , it is cheap and easy to use social media .
I also discover some of my friends ' interest which I find common with myself so that talking to one another is much more about life , study , friends , etc .
If anything wrong happened to the carrier 's life , without informing the family members it could make a huge regret in their life if she leaves without them knowing about it .
So I think whatever the genetic is or whether the gene is match with their parents , it should not be told to anyone even his or her family or relatives .
For example , in 2012 , there were false rumors of fires , shootouts , and caravans of gunmen in a Mexico City suburb which had spread through Twitter and Facebook .
There is a story of a girl who lives in social media world every night in eight years .
Consider a case , we decide to undergo genetic testing and have known the result of it .
So does social media network .
Seconly , the relatives of the carrier can also choose to do genetic testing regardless of the dignosis of the carrier .
However , there is a role and a sense of responsibility to inform their relatives since it is a genetic disorder .
A lot of people use their true information on social media sites , which can lead to crimes and deception .
Unlike the use of social media , most of the interaction is done with thinking and typing .
In certain aspects , social media has brought us quite a lot of convenience .
Once you suffer from cancer , the medication cost is very expensive .
It is a common scene that almost everyone in a public transport is watching at phone or wearing a pair ear piece in this modern society today .
Compared to face-to-face interaction , online conversation is easier for strangers to open their mouth to each other .
All in all , the appearance of social media truly helps people a lot in many areas .
This is because by the ease of technology such as airplane , some of our friends might be going overseas to continue their studies or even you are away from your family to pursue your studies or even careers in life .
When we were born , we were surrounded by our family and relatives , with them welcoming us to this new world .
Indeed , I myself use Facebook just because of the friends ' contacts that I want to keep .
It shortens the distance between people from all over the world and makes instant communication possible .
This is not the parent 's fault because there is still chances of the gene being inherited .
If you say only need to tell direct relatives , it will be against the fairness of law .
These advantages also comes in handy as most of these social media sites are accessible through mobile application in our smartphones .
However , there are two sides of stories always .
People can contact their friends on the internet and get their reply very fast .
Moreover , people can be aware of what is going on in social situation and see the comments online and share their opinions on these websites .
As a conclusion , once you have undergone the genetic testing and being aware of carrying some specific genetic risk , there are responsibilities to your relatives , yourself , and your following generations by telling your relatives and families the truth .
For a genetic risk carrier , there should be choice given with regards to informing his/her relatives .
Even for those patients with terminal diseases , the duration of their survival is 30 % longer due to the family support .
It is a common scene that two people sitting next to each other seldom talk with each other but just look at their cellphone .
It is not a heavy job for the family if they have prepare their mental first by disclosing the information of the probability that their children may suffer from the genetic disorder .
Nowadays , people can just easily put their renting information on their facebook account and wait for the response from others who are from different parts of the world which brings us a huge amount of convenience .
Those who are born into a family with a history of genetic disease should be allowed to undergo genetic testing , even though if there is no risk at all .
Moreover , this also provides an alternative way for people to contact a person whom they did not see for a very long time , such as their friends in primary school and secondary school .
The communication does not focus on how we feel , or to say , each otherm , but whatever is interesting , or the content .
Disadvantages : One of the main concerns of using social media platform to communicate is credibility .
Particularly , in the medical field , there is a great improvement in many treatments for many formally incurable diseases , and genetic testing is one of the methods which were used to diagnose an individual at risk for a genetic disorder .
As far as I am concerned , when a couple are going to have babies , they are going to run a few tests and see whether their could have some genetic diseases .
However , it also raised the concerns about whether it brings us more benefits or a human disaster .
Nevertheless , while I fell that a carrier should not be obligated to tell his or her relatives about the genetic risk , I would like to suggest the person to at least share the information with her or his potential partner ( husband or wife ) since the individual 's genetic risk may affect their future children .
Social media definitely has some other strong benefits that make the users stay is the links among the people .
Students can exchange their experiences in study even they are in different countries .
I think the family will stay mentally healty as it is , without having emtional stress .
One can not truly show their emotions by another by texting some = ) signs .
More supports must be provided through different means to give better direction when one is standing of such junction whether should him/her to inform the relatives .
On the contrary , social media makes people lose their ability to communicate effectively in their real lives and makes people risk exposing their privacy to those whose identity can not be verified on the social media sites .
It also reduces our sympathy .
Sometimes some family structure and cultural beliefs can influence the pattern of communication .
Although it looks like no laws and it is your own space to speak and do anything you want , you are actually wrong .
For every action there is always pros and cons .
Social media sites like Facebook and Twitter are born with the intention of connecting people , from around the world .
Some people fake their identities in media sites so that they can know more people or some may even cheat others .
Nowadays , it is quite common to see on some party , people would more prefer looking at their phones and reading all the posts on facebook if they feel bored .
Everyone does not want to see the scene of the broken family due to the carrier of a known genetic risk .
But , there will still be unreliable sources spreading false information on social media sites despite high security to control almost every social networking movement .
There are over thousand miles between Singapore and these two countries .
Relatives will certainly be supportive and show more caring towards the carrier of a known genetic risk .
In corporate world , employers often block social media network to prevent employees to spend their office time on their personal leisure than concentrating on their work .
Think in another way , if we put those time we spend on wandering on those sites , we may already finish one book or do other more meaningful things .
When things come to genetic issues , it is not that simple anymore .
Moreover , in the world we are living today , many miscarriages conducted in hospital every day .
In conclusion , a carrier of a known genetic risk should not be obligated to tell his or her relatives .
I started invoving into Facebook one years ago,when I just arrived singapore .
Thus , much thought need to put on the immediate family as it could caused a stir of unwanted events from the patient or the family members itself .
The government should set the law to protect this kind of privacy .
In addition , though it can be possible in some cases that he or she and the family can undergo specific discrimination in employment and their social life , how people can face more dramatic tragedy such as sickness or death if they can not even overcome this harsh situation .
Thus , socialisation can occur seamlessly and effectively with the utilisation of such social media platforms.Meet-ups and appointments are no longer a barrier for humans to contact and communicate with one another , making human interaction possible at one 's own convenience .
They may feel uncomfortable when they communicate with people face to face .
The cyber communication is quite different to face to face communication and people who depends on cyber communication too much will not get used to the real life communication .
People can express themselves through pictures or emotions .
People even prefer talk to their friends and meet their friends online and gradually reject face-to-face communication .
In this case , interpersonal skill is not as important because our goal is not to impress somebody , but to get the information that we are both interested in .
If you have n't undergone the genetic testing , it 's just odd and fate for what will happen to both of you and your relatives .
It can make people become closer as well .
Because of this , other people start to think that our lives are full of happiness with no problem at all .
Social media provides people with the opportunity to get contact with each other every time and everywhere .
Hence , our social circle is indeed expanding .
They may set a bias on this person even abandon his or her .
However , I belive that the carrier has right not to obligate to tell anyone but has responsibility to take an action to prevent any ethical dilemma .
Advantages and disadvantages of using social media in daily life
This essay will discuss the reasons why the relatives are obligated to be informed that their children have genetic risk .
After got the divorce certificate , the man showed her the test report ; it wrote that the woman carried the disease gene instead of the man .
However , as I said earlier , it is better for the person to at least tell about the potential risk to his or her future partner since his genetic risk may affect his children later .
In a nutshell , a carrier of a known genetic risk has the responsibility to tell his or her relatives .
The woman did not know the test result , but she overheard the talk and decided to divorce with her husband .
I believe 80 percents of people plays social media sites .
In retrospect , its is also ones duty to ensure that he or she undergo periodic healthchecks in their own .
Also , telling them the result can let them largely reduce the cost for multiple testing .
The idea seems great , and nowadays most people even the older generation will have at least one social media platform like Facebook .
However , we get less chance and less importance to talk face to face since social media is so convinient , advanced and interesting .
Taking Angeline Jolie for example , she is famous but she still revealed the truth about her genetic testing on the development of her breast cancer risk .
Albinism is one of the examples .
Writing is an essential skill of person who express their own feelings and opinions .
This is a potential danger for teenagers who are growing with social changes to get hurt .
And I am able to easily find a common topic when I contact them .
Again , there is a trend for them to suffer from social media addition and their study and work may be greatly influenced .
And there are two basic reasons .
It is almost imposible for us to keep way from it .
Other people should not be told without the person 's permission even though they are his or her family or relatives .
Genetic refers the chance of inheriting a disorder or disease .
In this case , the social network helps people to increase the frequency of talk .
People usually get this kind of hypertesion after they become adult .
With a small smart phone or a computer at school , at work or at home , we can easily make friends worldwide with a 'click ' and get to know about their life through having conversations with them , reading their blogs , photos and status .
Therefore an entirely new dilemma is born : should a carrier of a known genetic risk be obligated to tell his or her relatives ?
I agree that a carrier of a known genetic risk is obligated to tell his or her relatives .
This saves a lot of time for me in reading newspapers and watching TV .
The receipent,will then receive the information almost immediately depending on the quality of the network .
One of the disadvantage that many people concerns is that people loss the interest of face-to-face communication .
Carrier is responsible to balance his or her own interest and the benefits of family and even society .
The medical authorities claimed that only the individual who is at risk for a genetic disorder can make the decision to undergo genetic testing .
It can take a few days or weeks for those to receive the messages .
They can even make new friends over similar interests on these platforms , which will be able to connect almost everyone closely in many parts of the world .
At that time , the woman known how much her husband loved her but she ruined her happiness .
Sometimes I even canoot sleep well because of excitement .
Not only one but many developed and developing countries have the same picture .
Family members , as one the closest group of people from whom they can get comfort , is a crucial factor for them to successfully get over any possible troubles as a result of genetic disorder .
The broadcasting and viewing model is not good for forging relationships .
Many of them are busy in work and separate with their children .
Nevertheless , with those advantages , some disadvantages may appear such as reduction in face-to-face human contact which affects interpersonal skills , privacy issue , as well as some frauds that can be done through social media .
To tell or not to tell
Researches show that face-to-face meeting frequency among people that are addicted to social media sites has been decreasing .
Actually , I have seen some people are very funny and interesting when I am chatting with them online .
People and friends often mock of your conditions .
Social media has been playing a vital important role in our lives today .
The space of separation between the parties must also be looked at .
It seems that people build a good relationship with others by the social media , but the problems come out .
There are two advantages and two disadvantages of using the social media in people 's daily life .
In some cases , a carrier can suffer tension within a family because the result is also related to the others ' risk somehow .
