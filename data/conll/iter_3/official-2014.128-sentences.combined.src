The child with genetic risk may not have the ability to work , to build up the family with the others and most of the time they are not acceptable for the majority .
This type of communication does not help forging interpersonal relationships .
Even though you can not eliminate the risk completely , you can at least try to be alert to avoiding getting the disease .
This shows that a facebook friend may know more about you than your close friend who does not have a facebook account .

With the help of social media tools , we can stay in contact and keep ourselves up to date with our family and friends even though we are away from them .
From the above two points of view I think social media could forge more interest-based friendships .
Those who are born into a family with a history of genetic disease should be allowed to undergo genetic testing , even though if there is no risk at all .
Without their concern and support , we are hard to stay until this time .
As for those in your family who are more likely to be affected , they can go to the hospital to do the checks regularly .
As citizens of a nation , they have the responsibility to support their country in many ways .
This is especially to people who are overseas .

In old days , if one wants to tell some important news to another one , which lives far away , he needs to write letters and it wastes time .
However , there are arguments that social media life brings in a reduction in face-to-face human contact , which in turn affects interpersonal skills .
Life is hard but people can not blame it on being unfair .
Some scholars argue that the usage of social media reduces the face-to-face connection between human .
Nonetheless , what seems to make us connected can be the cause that falls us apart .
Therefore , this advantage of social media sites saves money and time , and also provides convenience for many people .
However , I believe that the benefits brought by these online chatting rooms tremendously outweigh their repercussions .

The broadcasting and viewing model is not good for forging relationships .
In conclusion , everything has its two-sided affect and it depends on how we exploit it .
If used for a good purpose , it can prevent unnecessary unhappiness , however , it could also make situation worse by revealing who the carrier is , in the family .

First , for the case of marrige , people should be honest and tell his/her spouce they may carry certain genetic risk that may affect their offsprings .
Despite one may argue that it 's still up to the individual to disclose such health issue or to bear it within him/herself , it 's certainly helpful to share with close relatives , for a proper discussion for solutions .
However , social media site is a double-sided sword , it also bring in some negative effect on our daily life .
However , hospital can provide a councilor to advice the carrier about the action can be taken .
