However , some people may argue that why we want to interfere with their lives ?
Therefore , I would agree to that it 's obligated for a carrier of known genetic risk to tell his or her relatives to avoid any family-related ethical dilemma that could be raise up in the future .
When one of his friends who is not aware of this has failed to contact him via telephone calls , he might be able to get his whereabout using social media .
However , I believe that the benefits brought by these online chatting rooms tremendously outweigh their repercussions .
So , they have to also prepare mentally .
Being the parent , you are not responsible to you next generations , since you allow the genetic risk to be passed on by generation and generation and being aware of it .
However , this can also be achieved from personal choice .
However , it is a good practice not to intesively use social media all the time .
In fact , I strongly think that the carrier should weigh both the positive and negative consequences of taking the genetic testing and tak an appropriate action to the results .
Since some of the information has already been revealed on the home page , it is also easier to find some common topics to talk about .
They worry a lot about the bad effect on the teenagers who are still developing themselves .
Generally , the clinic or hospital will not tell the carrier 's families without the agreement of carrier .
People can not avoid carrying the disease genes , which they born with .
It is not the broadcasters themselves they care about , but the content .
A family of four having dinners in a restaurant without any chatting , because their holding and looking at their display screen with one hand when the other hand is holding a fork .
Social media sites are also a very useful tool for people to start a new friendship or relationship .
Because of this , other people start to think that our lives are full of happiness with no problem at all .
Hence , they will be able to seek help from medical specialists to find a cure or to do some measures to prevent the risk of getting the disease .
That shows how actually news and information can be shared easily through social media .
Teenagers may believe these people and easily be cheat and lose money even their safe .
In real life , establishing friendship requires the all-rounded understanding in one another and the caring for one another .
Therefore , the social media is truly good for people .
Firstly , interpersonal skills may be affacted by the reduction in face-to-face human contact .
It is still early for parents to decide whether they can foster a new life that are not able to work and may suffer the pain in the entire life .
It is a common scene that almost everyone in a public transport is watching at phone or wearing a pair ear piece in this modern society today .
It is obvious that there will be better for one person to be worried than many .
The more we care about facebook , the less time we will have to spend with our friends .
It is easier for people to accept it morally .
The receipent,will then receive the information almost immediately depending on the quality of the network .
People can promote their friendship and relationship through these social media .
Social media has changed our ways of exchanging information and interpersonal relationships profoundly .
On the other side , we need to rethink about the influences brought by the social media .
On the other hand , there are also problems with the population of the social media .
By typing the words and showing the pictures , people can express their emotions that they are too shy to express .
People can only use electical devices to access internet .
There are a lot of disadvantages that people may not realize of .
Many people are very brave in telling people about their opinions online but in real life some of them can be very shy and not outspoken at all .
We share ideas , stories and forge friendship based on mutual respect .
If all efforts have been made but the children still suffer from the syndrome then the family have to accept this fact and do whatever they can to bring a good environment for their children 's growth .
Third , it is hard to define relatives .
However , we get less chance and less importance to talk face to face since social media is so convinient , advanced and interesting .
It makes people feel extreme close to their admirers ' lives and works .
Social media is only beneficial as long as we know how to use it in a correct and suitable way with the combination of both social media sites and daily life interaction to develop people 's potentials to the fullest .
Social media sites such as Facebook has allow us to share our pictures or even chat online with our parents while we are overseas .
Moreover , this also provides an alternative way for people to contact a person whom they did not see for a very long time , such as their friends in primary school and secondary school .
The children rely the parent to live .
We become so anxious that we can not focus on everything .
As time passed , we may have more " friends " on the list , but the meaning of friends needs to be redefined .
It is obvious to see that internet saves people 's time and also connect people globally .
In this modern world , the technologies were improved a lot compared with the last century .
As people spend more and more time on such social media sites , the importance of the face-to-face human contacts has decresed .
However , as I said earlier , it is better for the person to at least tell about the potential risk to his or her future partner since his genetic risk may affect his children later .
However , its disadvantages also can not be ingnored when you cosider it as a platform to show off and a stage for cyber crime .
In a nutshell , every sword has two edges .
Thanks to them , people can get to know one another online , without having to travel to meet up for business purposes for companies or personal reasons .
Whereas , it can also make people forget to communicate to their family and friends in the real life and affect negatively to their interpersonal skills .
To utilize the technology well , we should do our effort to not only balance the pros and cons but also lengthen the pros and shorten the cons .
Only by absorbing the essence and discarding the dregs can we make better use of the social media .
These sites play the role of connecting people around the world .
However , social media sites also have its second side of negative impact on human .
However , if you tell the truth to your wife and relatives , you offer a chance about whether to have child or not .
With the regulation of government and relevant authorities , the virtual world would be a better world .
However , there is news about the social media sites leaks users ' information to companies with cash reimbursement .
If one has a genetic disease after the test , he or she might not wish to inform the relatives as he might ended up dishearten his extended family .
Therefore , considering the people 's privacy and the existence of wrong testing , for the peace of the family , I support that a know genetic risk should not be obligated to tell his or her family or relatives without the person 's permission .
This lowers the experience of human ability to interact with one another which can adversely shape one 's behaviour .
One of the examples is the 2012 riots happened in Egypt and Zambia .
Afterall , what affects one family may or may not affect another although the families has a common genetic make up , shared by either of the parents .
Then eventually , she discovered that eight people became one as he was using eight different identities to chat with her all the time .
Updated news people care about can be easily obtained when you refresh your social media sites on your smart phones and laptops almost every time at any time .
This is especially to people who are overseas .
In old days , if one wants to tell some important news to another one , which lives far away , he needs to write letters and it wastes time .
Communication would have took a different turn without the easily available social media .
Among all kinds of different diseases , a large amount of different kinds of disorders are caused by genetic reasons .
Social media sites suppose be a very useful and convenient tool to use and bring people get closer in this globalised world .
Indeed , I myself use Facebook just because of the friends ' contacts that I want to keep .
Convenience and efficiency are two very important use of social media .
Firstly of all , social media can make it more convenient for people to make friends and contact each other .
However , such sparks of sudden attention is extremely short-termed and gone eaily thus does not add any value or meaning to the user 's life .
On social media , everyone is a broadcaster and a viewer .
We can know more news and cultures through socia medias .
In the days without the social networks , people may not have the chance to know others from different countries or the ones they never meet before .
People can know their friends ' recently looks and interesting things happens on that people just by checking their facebook or other social media sites .
The use of social media has largely influenced our ways in communicating with one another .
This would avoid the rise of more family-related ethical dilemma .
Everything will be bad if we do n't know how to use them wisely no matter whether it is really good or not .
After my Manager taught her mother how to use Facebook , she was able to upload video clips of her grandchild .
The question is whether a carrier of a known genetic risk should tell his or her relatives .
Using a common social media site with my friends to help me know what are their statuses nowadays .
There are three reasons as follows .
Recently , the rise of social media helped people to have more closer connection with each other , it is a more convenient and cheaper way to have online contact compared with face to face meetings .
Although it looks like no laws and it is your own space to speak and do anything you want , you are actually wrong .
And try to bypass the shortcomings .
And it becomes more convenient to obtain and update information by using social media .
Not long ago , the human genome project sponsored by several large multinational corporations ( MNCs ) has been started .
It also brings many negative effects such as loss of face-to-face communicating skills which is important in their working place .
At the same time , there will also be chances that the genetic test result is not correct which means they are actually wasting their lives worrying about this thing , so actually we are bringing trouble to them .
As a result , it is important for people to know that we need to be cautious about the time we spend on these social media .
Some scholars argue that the usage of social media reduces the face-to-face connection between human .
For example , hypertension is partially due to genetic factors , but environmental factors also play an important role .
Fundamentally , those who scored lower ranking for interpersonal skills are more likely to stumble when this skill is needed .
However , some people worry that social network can affect interpersonal skills as it reduces face-to-face human contact .
Therefore , the social media truly limit the interpersonal skills such that people lose the chance and the ability to practice talking and connect the relation between him and their friends .
And both are not what we want since most of us just want to live as normal people .
You can see people playing Facebook , Twitter through their smart phones or ipad on buses or on trains .
Or else , if he holds back the genetic risk , they may have a unhealthy baby and may cause the death of the baby or end of their marriage .
Human has their own rights and privacy .
Introverts or those who are shy to communicate with their friends are now able to do so in the form of words via social media platform .
Moreover , people can be aware of what is going on in social situation and see the comments online and share their opinions on these websites .
People can also get to know their friends ' state and mood by looking at their posts on line .
As a conclusion , once you have undergone the genetic testing and being aware of carrying some specific genetic risk , there are responsibilities to your relatives , yourself , and your following generations by telling your relatives and families the truth .
Surrounded by such concerns , it is very likely that we are distracted to worry about these problems .
Twitter , that has more simplified function compared to Facebook , gives more benefit if used as information sharing media .
It is not a heavy job for the family if they have prepare their mental first by disclosing the information of the probability that their children may suffer from the genetic disorder .
Demon is not easily to be defeated and it is required much of energy and psychological support .
Hence , it is essential to tell their family members about the risk of their genetic disorder both as a social responsibility and a favor to conserve the family basis .
What 's more , various of cultures can be shown to us through social medias .
Howard Garner mentioned that the different intelligences can be charted , in accordance of utilising tests , and ranked .
They will consider whether to give a birth to a new baby because of this genetic problem and they will start finding ways to try to avoid their baby to carry this genetic risk as well .
Secondly , genetic disease has a close relationship with the born gene together with their daily habits .
And even we gather together more people find themselves has less topics to talk than before and choose to digging from their social media again .
Let us take example from Facebook and Twitter , two of the most famous social media sites .
On the other hand , it may pass the disease to the next generation if the carrier hides the truth .
For every action there is always pros and cons .
The notion of authority also extended 'vertically' .
As the development of the technology , social media becomes more and more significant role in the whole world .
If the result turned out something that the carrier can not accept then it would have been better not knowing the truth .
You are not only controlled by the government laws but also spied by the government .
Furthermore , the convenience of social media is also its weakness .
In conclusion , in order to avoid the family-related ethical dilemma , it is best for any carrier of known genetic risk to inform his/her relatives .
It can make our life simpler .
Some family may feel hurt , with regards to their family pride or reputation , on having the knowledge of such genetic disorder running in their family .
It is therefore I would agree for the obligation of telling the relatives of both parties when one is about to get married and have a plan for giving birth .
And people on the other side will only need a second to receive the message .
This is the responsibility of being a parent .
The types of use must also be taken note of - informing , interacting , discussion and others .
What we can do is to educate the public about the importance of their friends just by their side and teach them to manage their time well .
However , there exits some disadvantages which will affect people in some degree .
In China , a lot of government organizations have open blogs to communicate with people , like firefighters , police stations and so on .
However , social media may do some harm to people 's life .
And now I got over 500 friends on Facebook and buried myself with hundrends of seeds every day .
This had caused panic among the people who had flooded the local police department with numerous phone calls , and this had resulted temporarily closed of schools .
Also , telling them the result can let them largely reduce the cost for multiple testing .
In this case , if one of the family members or close relatives is found to carry genetic risk , it is better for the patient to tell his/her close relatives about the issue and let others known about the risk so that his/her familay members are able to perform some daily excesses to prevent the potential disease or they may go to hospital and check for the correspongding flows .
As for those in your family who are more likely to be affected , they can go to the hospital to do the checks regularly .
So for the consideration for the other family members , the relatives should be informed .
Disadvantages : One of the main concerns of using social media platform to communicate is credibility .
However , in the case pertaining to any health issue or to the extent of serious disorder , it may seems no point of sharing but this involves more than just sharing of bad news .
Gone were the times , and now we do mass sending and the receiver may feel less meaning in such online wishes .
The users , soon , will realise that they do not need such social media sites to keep in contact with the their friends because , if they really need somebody , they will reach the friends no matter what .
Especially when it is just a risk , the option is really his since he is not an actual sufferer .
When ones chat on those media sites , there is no eye connection , no emotion delivery and even the expressions are typed in by using some combinations of punctuations .
And of course , he or she will think of not having any child after getting married , and the same thought goes to the cousins as well .
However , if a dignosed carrier is obligated to tell his or her relatives , the relatives will be forced to know their higher chance of being genetic risk carriers .
The society will adapt to such phenomenon as physical interaction are transformed into cyber interaction .
Any individual at risk for a disorder has the right to undergo genetic testing , but whether the results should be informed to others , especially close family or relatives , is the topic that worth discussing .
Sometimes it becomes extremely hard for them to accept this news especially if they are going to know that they or their descendants may have a severe disease like blood disease which is untreatable .
With the sharing of personal photos , posting of status of one 's personal feeling or experience and able to reply to these posts allowed human interaction to be engage and expand with ease .
The importance of informing relatives of such genetic disease is vital as it may help to raise awareness and prevention towards the genetic disorder .
Above all , life is more important than secret .
Although sometimes those genuine sharing of information may be inappropriate or even harmful , such as prevalent using of vulgarity and harsh-meaning comments , we can minimize those repercussions through strict regulations of content online .
Through Facebook , peope are able to maintain relationship with their old acquaintances .
Nevertheless , there are cyber polices who roam around these social networking platforms to prevent these hoaxes spreading around .
If they do not want to think too much of it and view it as a trouble , they may just ignore the possibility .
We know each others ' status , changements and so on through the social media .
This diagnosis can be regarded as a kind of privacy to carriers .
In the past , people used to writing letters to their friends and it will take relatively long time to send the letter over .
Besides , there are more people shwing their pictures of yummy food or travelling experience .
If a gene runs in the family , one of the family member test positive , whom does he need to tell .
Nowadays , people can even use their phone to read news and everyone can be the first witnesses of what is happening in the world .
Secondly , people 's over-addition may avoidably , to some degree , exacerbate social alienation , and this kind of alienation causes some social media users to suffer from the over-dependence of virtual social networking .
This will lead to a bad inter-personal skill as well as a problem of trusts .
There are two advantages and two disadvantages of using the social media in people 's daily life .
It might not be able to replace the joy that you have when you are with your family but it could help to reduce the sadness of being away from your family .
People will know about whether they carry a disease on their genes after they have done the genetic test .
Seconly , the relatives of the carrier can also choose to do genetic testing regardless of the dignosis of the carrier .
One advantage is that it is more convenience to contact others by social media .
In my opinion , the carrier of a known genetic risk has to tell his or her relatives about this .
Thus , you can see that some students will browse facebook while attending lectures .
Furthermore the act of informing others without the consent from their parents or the patients itself could harm the psychological state of the affected family .
While , once they are communicating with people in their face , expressing themselves appropriately become really a big problem .
However , the friendship on such virtual world is so superficial which is not so relevant to the real-life .
Although it helps to connect us with our friends wherever we are , it at the same time reduces the chance for us to talk to our friends face to face which may affect our interpersonal skills .
As a result , if the situation keep go on in this unexpected trend , it will cause a bad effect on the young generation .
In addition , cyber relationship can not always work in real life .
With the help of social media , I become real life friends with those from online forums whom I share the same interest with .
An extremely interesting and ironic phenomenon was discovered that a group of friends met and sat around one table , but none of them were really chatting with one another .
Secondly , the social media sites can not only connect people with their friends closely .
On the other hand , if there are ways can help us to control or cure the disease , we can going through thses process from the scope of the whole family .
Privicy protection belongs to one 's human rights .
These social media may be tools of their campaign and manipulating the thoughts of the public .
However , not everybody is so lucky that they can make sure they do not carry any disease genes .
It not only is convenient and beneficial in connecting people and developing the business but it also can damage people relationships and interpersonal skills .
As the result , it is in the interests of the carriers and their relatives , telling the genetic testing result is needed .
This might be beneficial for his future if he is aware of the risk of having this disorder .
The audience is not some specific person , but everyone we might know , or even the entire world .
In the chat room , she created a close relationship with eight people .
Actually , I have seen some people are very funny and interesting when I am chatting with them online .
It provides people with more convenient contact environment and improve the frequency of meeting with each others .
For myself , I am long to some places after I saw those beatiful pictures taken by my firneds .
Therefore , telling the families and the relatives to get prepared for fighting the disease and even prevent to get the disease is your responsibility .
A study of New York University in 2010 shown that patients with family members around generally recovers 2-4 days faster than those taken care by professional nurses .
Many syndromes such as Down Syndrome and Taylor Syndrome can be prevented to happen if the mother undergo proper medication and do n't consume harmful goods during the pregnancy period .
Moreover , people usually like to share boldly about their real feelings online with their masks in reality being taken off .
Thus , having the knowledge that such genetic disorder is benign would be beneficial towards their emotinal thoughts .
However , as we then tend to spend too much time on this and have significantly reduced in face-to-face human contact , that eventually affects our interpersonal skills .
Thus , we are going to identify the advantages and disadvantages of the issue which is " should or should not " .
There may be some people who say that it is necessary to tell the family members about the risk since some of them may be affected , while I do think that this view has a point , how much you can trust your family regarding this issue may also be a case .
In conclusion , everything has its two-sided affect and it depends on how we exploit it .
The government should set the law to protect this kind of privacy .
In addition , it is impractical to make such a law .
Some will take long time and some are not efficient enough for people to get their response .
In conclusion , although the unsafe online environment , spend too much time on internet may be the potential negative factors of using online social networks .
This covenience can be percieved as almost in realtime .
There are over thousand miles between Singapore and these two countries .
Social media provides people with the opportunity to get contact with each other every time and everywhere .
People do not have the ability to choose their gene , they should not be thought badly because of bad gene .
It can make people become closer as well .
Nowadays , even some companies conduct online video interview with their applicants as it saves time and cost .
Overall , there are more benefits than the costs .
Some will wish to keep it to themselves and hope to ensure that they will not bring in any pessimism into their family .
Personally I feel that we still should take our responsibility to tell them the situation .
We all know that life is priceless and we have no right to judge a person 's death .
Some may say that the appearance for these modern media will reduce the chance for people to communicate face to face .
They may do not want this truth to influence their life or want to keep it as a secret and do not others know about it .
More and more young people tend to live in social media world most of their time and reduce face-to-face human contact , which can affect interpersonal skills and relationships in social life .
The broadcasting and viewing model is not good for forging relationships .
Other than that , I believe that the stong bond we have with our family is the biggest pillar of support to the carrier .
Another advantage of social media is in aiding the spread of democracy .
More and more advertisements can be found on Facebook , whether it is our friends who sell their products or professional brands selling their products online , we can get to buy and contact the sellers through those sites , which can be considered as an advantage for us , the buyers .
Therefore , the decision to inform relatives of such genetic disorder will be dependent of the situation and backgroung of the affected family , with the liberty of choice given to them in making the decision of informing others .
I find that it is important to inform especially if it is contagious , the carrier could prevent the disease from spreading out to the society .
Think of the other way , if a child of the family knows that he has the risk to become a genetic risk carrier , and the risk might as well inherit to his child in the future , his whole life will be in a dilenma .
These social media serves a purpose to bind people in spite of their geographical boundaries but it does n't mean that surrounding people are neglected as the payoff .
The people with albinism have sensitive skin and it needs regular treatment .
They play the important role in our life which can not be substituted .
These malicious comments often go viral and it creates a strong negative effect on the real user in real life , which might lead to unwilling attitude to interact with others in real life by the victim .
In business area , social media is a good tool to develop and advertise products and services .
If anything wrong happened to the carrier 's life , without informing the family members it could make a huge regret in their life if she leaves without them knowing about it .
Furthermore , this lack of physical interaction has affected human inter-personal behaviour since communication is made through social media instead of meet-ups .
Secondly , without the truly communication in the real life , people lose the ability to see the truth and false .
This is because his or her relatives have the right to know about this .
In addition , " social media sites will affect writing skills " , that is the point of view in society .
The idea of searching for democracy is passed from Egyptians to people in Zambia quickly through the use of social media .
Hence , they should be the people be grateful for and the people we would like to share the joy together .
As a result , they will lose eyes to contact and hands to express their feeling to people nearby them , which means they have lost the tools they need for face-to-face contact communicating .
Nowadays , with the development of technology and society , social media become more popular and even important in our daily life .
This is their human right to know about that , and this may also save their lives by preventing the disorder to happen .
And we keep track of all family members health conditions .
Then wife D might tell her mother , who likes to gossip on her way to the theatre .
The issue on right to know or not to know is highly debatable although it is a genetic risk , one can not be entire sure because the genetic information could possibly result from the families of either parents - his maternal and paternal uncles , aunts or cousin .
Social media sites are at their peaks at the moment , however , I believe that when people realize that such sites are not making them better persons in real-life , they will not be indulged in it as much as they are now .
For people who are living very far from one another , the intensive use social media is justified .
Nowadays , people not only pursuit the comfort of their own life but also a better development of their following generations .
In the sophisticated era like these days , experts keep producing inventions that are meant to make life easier .
It might not be accurate to judge the other party 's feelings over social media as one may cover up their emotions while on social media .
Once we found we were carrying this genetic risk , it is better for us to tell our family members because they may carry it as well .
There is no need to for people to go out of their home to interact with others , they chat online , share pictures , tell others what they have done or funny stories .
Nothing is absolute right or wrong .
Since this will really affect their lives , what we should do is to try to make it in a positive way .
Social media has reshaped the way of communication .
If there is no social media , it is difficult for people to know about a stranger .
Genetic risk does carry its consequences and should not be taken lightly within the family circle .
There should not be forced or obligied to do so , as it may negatively and drastically affect the emotions of the genetic risk carrier .
No pledge of authenticity risks people 's information and privacy that are shared on social media sites .
That plays an important role in the possibility that relatives can overcome the discrimination of the society and anxiety about the risks .
With my social network account , I seldom read newspapers or go to news websites anymore ; because I can easily read them from the status of my friends .
Genetic disorder inheritance is generation by generation , but not all of the offsprings show the relevant symptoms .
Advantages and disadvantages of using social media in daily life
However happy they were before , there would be some barrier appears which will truly destroy the family gradually .
If your genetic results indicate that you have gene changes associated with an increased risk of heart disease , it does not mean that you definitely will develop heart disease .
However , there are also a great amount of people who against this technology .
She talked with them every night , trust them and share her life with them .
The next point is that telling relatives can raise their awareness of having the similar genetic disorder , preventing certain genetic disorders to affect themselves .
On top of that , as the genetic risk may pass down to next generation , thus it will involve more than just one family .
My answer is no .
In addition , social network site can help you keep in touch with friends living very far away .
Otherwise , making it an obligation will restric the choice of carriers and bring a lot of confusion to their relatives .
This is a potential danger for teenagers who are growing with social changes to get hurt .
As for the disadvantages of social media in our daily life , wasting time , causing illness related to sitting long time before the computer , quick-spread of rumor and fake news , most importantly , making people lost the ability to talk to others face to face confidently .
What we can do is to cautiously manage our time spent online and manage our words used online .
On the other hand , when the teenager is studying in a foreign country , the internet is the only way that he can communicate with their parents and friends .
Ultimately , one must bring attention to who may benefit from such information and assisting those at risk to make considered decisions about disclosure .
Some of them may have changed their phone numbers and addresses , and we are not able to find them through a phone or a letter .
This is an issue need to be addressed as family-related ethical dilemma is involved .
People can also know much information about the celebrity in Twitter and Facebook such as Obama , Bill Gates and get the first-hand study materials on it .
If the carrier refuses to tell the truth to his or her spouse , another life may have risk of inheriting the genetic disease .
So we need to make best use of these social media and make it a fun way of adding some excitement when life is boring .
Therefore , while social media sites are undoubtedly have benefits in our life , we should consider its drawbacks and thus use it wisely so that we can gain more of their benefits and it disadvantages us in the smallest way as possible .
He or she has the right not to tell anyone .
The social media is beneficial as it connect you and your loved one even though you are separated by the distance .
Besides that , these skills requires time to develop and adapted .
I met some canadian friends in Egypt .
With an increasing users of more than billion users from all over the world , social media sites have demonstrated clearly its success in playing an important part of our life .
Take H1N1 as an example , all the people in Singapore including students at school , travelers at the Changi Airport , workers in the office as well as passengers on the street are forced by law to take their temperature and report the result to the relevant government authority in charge .
The next two paragraphs will be discussing about the advantages and disadvantages of using social media in our society .
Years ago when these modern products have not been popular , the way for people to communicate or contact people far way are still restricted in making phone calls , sending emails or writing letters .
It may affect our daily lives and we will think about it every day .
There are advantages and disadvantages in itself , however , whether it is good or bad we are still not sure .
As a result , what should we do ?
However , from the ethical point of view .
In Singapore , many Malaysian cross the sea to work here .
In conclusion , it will be considerate to inform the risk of getting the same genetic disease to the relatives .
One might also choose to hint or encourage their certain relatives to run a gene test if they are concerned about negative consequences that comes across when they disclose their genetic results .
Many people argue that this is the most serious problem brought by social media sites .
Firstly , genetic testing is not something that is compulsory .
People get connected or closer with same preferences .
For example , diabetes is a kind of genetic disease .
Also , human being should improve the medical field in order to prevent the tragedy happen .
Focus on the negative side of the annouance of genetic risk first .
This results in lack of interpersonal skills in individual , especially young students as they always have option to turn their back to the real-life and go online .
Some of the famous examples would be social media sites like Twitter and Facebook .
Many people in our society are not well informed about many genetic diseases and many of them will most likely to judge or at least differentiate those who have genetic diseases since they feel that the patients are abnormal or 'weird' .
We can not be certain for sure the reliabilty or truth of some posts or information we received through the Inetrnet .
Their number of people that they know may only limited to the people they meet in daily life like classmates and working partners .
As it is a genetic risk,the patient next-of-skin might have a high chance of carrying the risk,hence the need to inform their relatives is important so that necessary prevention actions could be taken before unforeseen circumstances might occur.For example,if you are the only child in a family and unfortunately,you are suffering from a genetic disease that the genetic trait might be passed on to your next generation if you have a child,hence by letting your family members aware of the situation,it would lessen family stresses and suffering on forcing you to settle down and have children.However , social ethic issues like discrimination and privacy are biggest concerns and potential barriers to enforce patients or doctors to disclose information to patients relatives.It challenges the confidentiality and privacy principles.Currently , under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 ( HIPAA ) in the United States,there is no legal obligation requirement to disclose information to relatives,it is up to the patient 's wish to disclose to their family members.Early disclosement to family members brings in positive reaction and prevention,as in the case of Angelina Jolie,she chose to disclose information and underwent treatment to reduce the risk of breast cancer significantly to under five percent.I still can recall her reason for disclosing her own story was that she does not want to live under the shadow of cancer .
I could understand the feeling of the carrier .
If used for a good purpose , it can prevent unnecessary unhappiness , however , it could also make situation worse by revealing who the carrier is , in the family .
Some may even do something wrong .
He may have different considerations other than due to the judging people or may result in making his family worry for nothing when thinking of whether he should tell it to his relatives , and no matter what choice he makes , we need to respect it and we have no right in saying that he must tell his relatives about it .
Genetic testing is a personal choice .
Therefore an entirely new dilemma is born : should a carrier of a known genetic risk be obligated to tell his or her relatives ?
One of the advantages which are carried by those social media sites is that they can connect us more closely than before .
For example , breast cancer is a genetic disease and it can be cured if it is being realised in the early stage .
Firstly , someone having what kinds of disease belongs to his or her privacy .
Some say that it is a necessary step for human revolution .
It will make him or her quite upset when they communicate in real life .
It can take a few days or weeks for those to receive the messages .
When their children become teenagers , a lot of social problems may arise .
It is because a carrier with bad gene may not necessary have those genetic disease , if they can have coresponding healthy lifestyle before the age that the gene 's function become stronger .
Some say it is a kind of invasion of privacy for the carrier and should be protected .
These are the advantages that save works most of the time .
Secondly , genetic diseases costs highly for the treatment and medication .
So does social media network .
It is a mental unhealth and it may trigger people especially teenagers to become material .
Not only the phone did the jobs for them , but also devices like personal computer , laptop , tablet , and many other devices which are able to connect to internet .
Nevertheless , they still can use phone to do normal call and message to contact .
They should let their spouse know about his or her situation before marriage .
Many people think that the social media sites have benefits on the communication between people while some others argue that there are several negative impacts for the society .
However , it leads to a new problem that " should a carrier of a known genetic risk be obligated to tell his or her relatives ?
It can be very difficult for them but necessary for the carriers and their family .
Overall , I belive that it entirely depends on the carrier to share the hard facts and face it with relatives but he has no obligation to tell still .
Social media provides people a way of talking and chatting which can never be considered as a way of communication .
With the families ' support , there must be more energy to fight against with the demon .
He or she might even be adviced not to get married or have children .
First and foremost , we should realize that social media world is not trustworthy and real .
In this fast pace and competitive world , people may not able to keep in touch with others .
Many people many argue that setting the obligation may help more people , who are the relatives of the carriers , save their lives with a larger opportunity because of the early diagnosis .
They pointed that actually social media reduces the chance for us to talk to people around us face to face .
Also , as numerous profit-driven companies realize the hugh human traffic on such social media sites , they make it as a pond to fish the customers by uploading many advertisements .
But they are all from one family and own the same forefather , then of course they own the same genes in some part .
Furthermore , since it is the person 's gene that is affected , he has the right to determine with whom he wants to share the information with .
Twitter , Facebook and Skype are some social media sites which enable us to keep in touch with our friends or family who are in other cities or countries .
Researches show that face-to-face meeting frequency among people that are addicted to social media sites has been decreasing .
Furthermore , as it could incur spending a lots of money for the treatment , the carrier might not want to be the burden in her family .
While most people agree that each individual has his own right to decide whether to undergo a genetic test or not , they have different stands in whether it is the patient 's responsibility or freedom to share the result with his or her relatives .
At the same time , we are prepared to know when there are other members got this disease .
There also exists some probability of wrong testing .
In addition , there are also some false reports and fake IDs occur on both social media sites that people use fake ID to insult or harass someone , like the case of Heather Chua occurred recently on Facebook .
Next , communication are also greatly improved .
Hence , the social media sites serves as a platform for the connection .
If not their family then who else that are willing to do that ?
It makes people worry since if all the teenagers continue using social media frequently , they will decrease the ability to talk to people .
This is not the parent 's fault because there is still chances of the gene being inherited .
More and more illness are discovered to be related to some genes with the development of the medical technology .
I also discover some of my friends ' interest which I find common with myself so that talking to one another is much more about life , study , friends , etc .
Life is hard but people can not blame it on being unfair .
For a carrier of genetic disorder to know the fact that he or she is a carrier , it causes more dilemma rather than getting the disorder .
Everyone does not want to see the scene of the broken family due to the carrier of a known genetic risk .
With the frequent usage and reliance of the social media and the Internet , a society that socialises through the cyber will be more advance and adapted to the highly connected world .
When we were born , we were surrounded by our family and relatives , with them welcoming us to this new world .
However , some think that it might be better for those who are ignorant about it and will continue leading a happy life .
However , people now can contact with anyone all over the world who can use computer at any time , and there is no time delay of messages .
Hence , there were also tensions if participants felt that they could neither pass on information to relatives who needed to know ( such as nieces and nephews ) nor persuade those with authority ( the parents ) to do so .
Social media enables people from different parts of the world to communicate with one another .
We should take the advantages of the creatures we create and try to avoid the negative effects .
However , there are arguments that social media life brings in a reduction in face-to-face human contact , which in turn affects interpersonal skills .
The latter requires face to face interaction where we can show our emotions to the other .
I am most inclined to believe that his or her relatives have the rights to know the result .
Firstly , when people rely on the social media to communicate with their friends and parents , they will accustom to communicate by typing and not talking .
Firstly , the social media sites can connect people with their friends and parents closely .
On the other hand , social media sites also bring some negative impacts for the people and the society .
The spreading of false information can be a potential psychological threat to everyone , given that social media can disseminate information in a realtively fast speed .
In my opinion , as long as we keep our mind healthy and strong , we can fight any disease as they come to us when we are fragile and weak .
They may set a bias on this person even abandon his or her .
As a result , one does not train the necessarily parts of the skills required for a proper interpersonal relations .
For an example , if we change our contact numbers , we will not send SMto each of individual any longer .
It is hereditary .
They are too busy with their way too many virtual friends and some of them neglect the feelings of their real-life friends .
We should maximize the benefits of such platforms but be careful of its impacts on the actual life that we have .
Everything we type in the social media sites is recorded in the server and then transfer to the companies for spying and advertising .
As for the advantages , there are two aspects : more convenient to contact others , easier to know about others .
They will feel it becomes difficult for them to find any topics to communicate with other people .
Even when people are thousands of miles apart , social media make it possible to have interaction by keep writing comments .
Howard Garner studied the effect of multiple intelligences amongst people and stated that interpersonal intelligence is a form of skills on its own - some has it , some does not .
Therefore , I think a known genetic risk should not be obligated to tell his or her family or relatives without the person 's permission .
If the carrier does n't tell his or her relatives , it may be too late to get their support and prepare financially .
Many people may support with a theory that every people have their right to enjoy the world , especially people with religions .
No more worries about the time it takes to deliver letters and packages .
This phenomenon is caused by rapidly changing technology , which has made communication to be faster than never before .
Having to meet and interact for talks allows one to be closer to the recepient .
A research shows that people will unconsciously hide his or her real thought when he or her say or post something that will be exposed to the public .
On one side , it is obvioualy that many advantages have been brought to our lives .
This becomes a huge problem when they have no choice but have to face things in real life .
The appearance of those social media sites causes those problems to be solved .
In a nutshell , a carrier of a known genetic risk has the responsibility to tell his or her relatives .
The carrier should be honest with his or her feeling and I find that it is the right of the family member to know what is going on to his or her life .
The decision to undergo genetic testing can only be made by the individual at risk for a disorder .
He can even talk to her daughter face-to-face using video call via internet .
We can not blame them that they are liable to the undesired consequences .
Furthermore , not everyone on the social media sites is honest .
This skill requires practices and can not be done completely through social media .
I believe most of us have the experience of suddenly forget how to write a word that we should know .
However , social media solves these problems well .
It may be awkward and embarrassed for a person to tell relatives that he or she is a carrier of a known genetic risk .
Moreover , some wrong values on the websites will affect teenagers and confuse them .
The profile picture may not be the person who that user says he or she really is .
People used to write letters and send post cards to keep in touch with ones live far away from them in the past .
Social media are able to improve relationship and make new friends , provided that there is mutual trust and mutual understanding between both parties .
In my opinion , the patients , which are carriers of some known genetic risk are supposed to share the truth with their family members .
In the view of my point , a carrier of a known genetic risk should not be obligated to tell his or her relatives , with the support of the following reasons .
There are more intangible advantages that could support the stand of informing the relatives once the results are known after the test conducted .
Therefore , the social media is not safe which is bad to teenager 's future development .
It is a hard decision to make but with the most appropriate way , it will create great circumstances for the carrier and families in the future .
Everyone in the world can not stop using it every day to express their feelings or ideas and a log of other stuff which helps their friends know their lives better .
It is our responsibility to identify the advantages and disadvantages of social media sites .
The lack of exposure to real life interaction with humans with not create the confidence and skills needed for one to interact seamlessly and effectively with others .
Large numbers of patients with the genetic risk would want to keep it as a secret as the genetic risk may indicates their high chance to carry certain disease .
Nevertheless , the advantages of social media will benefit the masses if the negative aspects of it can be carefully taken care of .
If they do not even know that they are at risk for a genetic disorder , how can this explain their right ?
His relatives can then take measures , if this disease can some how be prevented , to stop this disease from taking their lives .
There are advantages and disadvantages in using social media sites , however in this case striking balance between social media and lives is the most important thing to do .
It could rather be better for him or her this way .
It is better for both parties to be honest .
On the one hand , it can tell members of the carrier 's family the possible disease they may have and can perform treatment in time if possible .
The answer is simply that everyone , especially our family , has the right to know the truth .
Everyone can easily make up the personality and characteristics they want .
That is true and of course it is the obligation of a family member to protect and take care of the family .
Although some people feel that an individual who is found to carry a dominant gene for Huntington 's disease has an ethical obligation to disclose that fact to his or her siblings , there currently is no legal requirement to do so .
From some points of view , social really has a lot of advantages by let us communicate with friends cheaper and more conveniently .
Genectic testing is a personal decision , with the kowledge that there is a possiblity that one could be a carrier or not .
As this happens , users are more and more pron to any possible frauds .
As explained above , modern and sophisticated technology does n't always give advantages .
I agree that a carrier of a known genetic risk is obligated to tell his or her relatives .
Taking Angeline Jolie for example , she is famous but she still revealed the truth about her genetic testing on the development of her breast cancer risk .
A known genetic risk can also affect our next generation critically .
Personally I feel more at ease on social medias .
The question given is whether a carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to tell his or her relatives and I think that the carrier should not be obligated to do so because I belive that he or she has right not to know .
That is the most essential elements to overcome the challenges .
To prevent that from happening , I do feel that it is up to the person whether he wants to share the information with his family since his family may either be paranoid or judge him and act differently .
However , hospital can provide a councilor to advice the carrier about the action can be taken .
This means one of his parents has gene A and one cost of testing could be saved .
People may feel angry , depressed , or even guilty about their results .
How can they not tell their loved ones who they really are and get their loved ones in danger ?
The last but not the least , with all kinds of personal information on one 's social network page , it is covenient for criminal to make use of this information to commit a crime .
The reason why it is so addictive is , that the more people get into the social media , they seek attention from their friends .
One of the disadvantage that many people concerns is that people loss the interest of face-to-face communication .
In conclusion , I think social media has reshaped interpersonal relationships from a more human-based friendship that requires sharing and caring between friends , to a more information-based friendship that requires a mutual interest .
As many people realize , a genetic disorder can be related to the carrier 's relatives , that is , one of the family members is at risk for a genetic disorder means that other family members also have almost the equally risk to have it , so this problem should be treated seriously by the family .
Without facebook , we may lost contact .
The situation may become worst if the child has diseases like cancer or heart disease , which means that parents have another heavy baggage named medication fees .
The communication is also not limited in words .
We can not deny that the genetic testing really helps people a lot when they face the disorder problem .
As stated above , I strongly believe that if we can use social media wisely rather than abusing it , we will all live a better life .
The advancement of those social media sites makes people so rely on them that some of them rather prefer using those sites to contact each other than talking to each other face to face .
With a globalised and interconnected world today , Twitter and Facebook are now the mainstream platform for social interaction .
This improves the connectivity between the users .
Thirdly , some diseases are not noticeable and may lead to serious health problems .
While millions of users are connect at any one time , any information can be readily available at their perusal .
When we are diagonosed out with certain genetic disease , are we suppose to disclose this result to our relatives ?
Furthermore , some will wish not to become a burden of anyone as seeking medical attention is relatively costly .
Therefore my Manager would not miss the moments of her daughter 's growth .
Twitter only allow users to give update that is limited to short sentences in order to spread the words fast , that only highlighted messages are delivered .
Especially for the young people without marrige , if he/she is known to have some genetic risk , it may have certain chance that his/her child would carry the same disease , but not in certain .
In conclusion , whether or not the carrier wants to tell his relatives regarding his genetic risk , the choice is his because it is his own gene and he has the full right of it .
Sometimes some family structure and cultural beliefs can influence the pattern of communication .
From the example that I have mentioned earlier we can see that distance between us and our loved one are getting further apart .
First and foremost , all social media sites are free .
Thus , this makes Twitter and Facebook become one of the medium that we need .
However , they behave quite boring when I talk to them in real life .
Other relatives may have the same possibilities to have such kind of disease .
For the countries like Singapore , they are short of manpower to contribute to the nation .
However , if you have undergone and known that you are a carrier , you are responsible for your whole family .
Secondly , annouance the potential risk would cause the family member to be scared of this certain issue , although the factor would not be that serious , people would still fear that they would have some potential disease in the future thus go to hospital and do additional check or take more medicine in order to prevent the disease , and this creats unnecessary costs to the family .
Advantages : Social media sites have greatly ease long distance communication and interaction due to its accessibility and convenience .
As more and more social websites such as Twitter , Facebook and Weibo which have become ubiquitous , seamless and imperative in our life , people may worry about the young generation having problems in face-to-face communication skills .
The most obvious reason for those who argue for this opinion is that the relatives of the carrier are at high risk of carrying these diseases .
It has erased the boundaries of distance and time .
Geographical and transportation borders are not a problem anymore because communication and information technologies were enhanced continuously .
Think in another way , if we put those time we spend on wandering on those sites , we may already finish one book or do other more meaningful things .
And if you are not on it , you will just get lost .
All users ' needs are an internet connection and an email account so that everyone can have a Facebook or Twitter ID to start their journey in social media life .
Social network plays a role in providing and also filtering information .
If you say only need to tell direct relatives , it will be against the fairness of law .
If the knowledge of the genetic risk was to be shared within the family or relatives , there might have chances for them to have it in their blood , which they may do necessary precautions to prevent .
This kind of behaviour is not good to people 's psychological health according to a research .
People connecting through the social media sites can spend no money on the communication , and also take only one or a few seconds for the message to reach .
This is because many relate genetic diseases to those such as Bubble-Boy disease , autism or down-syndrome .
This should be accepted from the point of human right , freedom of acceptance of relatives as well as many other social reasons .
Firstly , what is the range of the relatives ?
One definitely has the right to disclose his or her health issues to anyone , but it 's also one 's responsibility to inform the family and close relatives .
This competitive world is cruel to those are not able to survive .
The images we choose to present are tentatively considered .
Therefore , the popularity of social media sites have made it more convenient for people ot update friends ' status and contact with friends more frequently .
It not only affect the interpersonal skills but also bad for people 's health if the ones spend to much time on the social media .
People with close blood relationship generally carry some similar genes .
Imagine you are living like a normal person but suddenly one day your relative comes tells you that actually there are some possibilities that you may encounter some disease in the future , what kind of feeling are you going to have ?
Substantial cost is saved without the tiring travel from one point to another point .
One of the reasons that the parents should be informed is that they have to decide whether they are capable to raise a child with genetic risk .
Secondly , people makes friends all over the world and able to update their friends his recent activity easily .
The certainty of what is being shared or expressed could not be proven physically as media limits this physical interaction , except when using a webcam to chat .
When our phones are accidentally done , we can also use the social media to get contact with our friends .
We should know that although we may affect their lives , we can still let them make correct choices in the future .
In this case , interpersonal skill is not as important because our goal is not to impress somebody , but to get the information that we are both interested in .
I started invoving into Facebook one years ago,when I just arrived singapore .
The relation between parents and children is something about love and dedication .
On top of that , it is better to think about solutions for her problem with the family members as there are more heads to think about it rather than thinking about it alone and struggling on your own .
However , it will become a controversial issue as it becomes a dilemma for a carrier of a known genetic risk to inform his or her relatives .
In my opinion , the responsibility of telling family and relatives is quite obvious .
However , communication on social media is largely based on " broadcasting and listening " .
This piece of information does play a role in family planning matters , therefore although no one is obliged to tell about their genetic risk to anyone , it should be encouraged to tell it to their future partner .
So I think whatever the genetic is or whether the gene is match with their parents , it should not be told to anyone even his or her family or relatives .
In most of the countries , there is an emergence of social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter .
In China , the older generation with traditional culture background , will always think of having more children as well as grandchildren , to make the family liven up and stronger .
To put it in the nutshell , I believe that people should have the obligation to tell their relatives about the genetic testing result for the good of their health .
Also , they will not have enough experience to communicate with people in face and not be trained in their conversation skills .
'Privacy ' , this is the word that popular in these few decades .
With the huge amount of cost savings , this capital can be utilized in the other sectors which benefits company more and boost up the company 's profit .

This essay will discuss the reasons why the relatives are obligated to be informed that their children have genetic risk .
Usually people are not aware if they carry the sickle cell gene and this may lead to circulatory problem such as blood blocking .
One of the reasons why is because as a carrier , she or he needs a mental support to go through with this situation .
Firstly , social media brings convenience to the world .
The benefits of doing so are able to outweigh its disadvantages .
Some people may say that telling the truth may arise some unnecessary doubts and panics which will endanger the family harmony .
The seriousness can be larger than our imagination .
If the parents know that one of them is a carrier and disclose the information to their relatives then they can bring their children to undergo genetic testing and do n't need to be shy of it because it is for the sake of their children 's health .
However , social network helps people to meet and chat much more easier , they can even use video chat and create group chat to chat with multiple parties at the same time .
With current booming technology , it is agreeable that people become more technology-savvy and they want to spend more time interacting with each others through social media sites , however , it does not mean that we should neglect face-to-face human interaction as it plays even a more important aspect in our life .
And the information collected may not be intact and true .
We discuss every thing we like and we have more personal space.Our friends also got more access to know what we are doing and what we like .
In my opinion , every individual has to take responsibility of their own lives by making a right decision .
But overall , the advantages far outweigh its disadvantage .
If I am interested in politics , I can just follow some politics newspapers or public figures .
The basis of a family is that everyone trusts and love each other with no doubts .

From a practitioner 's perspective these findings are important because if lay constructs of the family and kinship are a social construct they may not be in line with geneticists ' views of family relationships , or about which blood ( or non-blood ) relatives should be informed and by whom ; this is also likely to be dependent on the cultural and ethnic context .
A group of friends having high tea in a caf é without chatting as well , because they do not know what to talk but pressing on their display screen .
First of all , it can be an alert for the family members of the patient and let them be aware of the possible disease that they may also have .
In the age of rapid technological advancement , a lot of medical breakthroughs are made possible .
The opposite is also true .
This is because by the ease of technology such as airplane , some of our friends might be going overseas to continue their studies or even you are away from your family to pursue your studies or even careers in life .
All-in-all , social media is the product of rapid technological advancement and there are more to come in future .

Today world is considered to be the era of social media sites like Facebook and Twitter which are attractively connecting people around the world .
In certain aspects , social media has brought us quite a lot of convenience .
That is why facial impression is one of the most important elements in social learning .
There is a situation where a family is having a dinner together in a restaurant but everybody is busy with their own gadget , posting picture in Facebook , updating status on Twitter , or even chatting with friends .
As I mentioned in the beginning , there is also disadvantages of social media tools .
Unlike just keeping contact numbers that we may not even call , social media like facebook is a great way for friends from different field or even from different parts of the world to be connected .
Therefore , this kind of circumstances will not be happened again and again .
Moreover , in the world we are living today , many miscarriages conducted in hospital every day .
On the other hand , with the help of social media , some homeless people or someone who need the money to cure the disease can get the help from the world quickly because once one person know the information , his or her will share it to their " friends area " , then many people will know it and spread the information to the person who can give help .
Some people who are try to talk in the public can also actively take part in the group chatting via social media .
When we are far away , social media makes it as we are infront of each other ; sometimes when we are by each others ' side , we are seem to be further than far away .
Nowadays , as the technology is becoming increasingly advanced , more and more social media sites are showing up in our daily life .
Thus I believe that social media sites are one of useful tool to help people known each other better .

The communication does not focus on how we feel , or to say , each otherm , but whatever is interesting , or the content .
However , there are risks of false information and chances of miscommunication .
Genetic testing has become a beneficial way to predict and protect each individual at risk for a disorder .
Early pre-examination is healthy as it will cast away unwanted doubts and affect the psychological thoughts of those who are affected .

These advantages also comes in handy as most of these social media sites are accessible through mobile application in our smartphones .
For an example , one is able to send notifications and other information we use to have them in hardcopy previously , over the web and the process takes seconds .
Interpersonal skills , like any other skills requires practice .
Sometimes life may even be saved if they are told early and conduct timely treatment .
Therefore , for an effective and efficient society , there is a need to have a balance of both social media interaction and face-to-face human interaction within its people .
As citizens of a nation , they have the responsibility to support their country in many ways .

Carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to tell his or her relatives
The social network may also creat some negative impacts for the people .
It shortens the distance between people from all over the world and makes instant communication possible .

On the other hand , if the genetic risk is kept as a secret , although it may benefit the carrier to a certain extend and help to keep the privacy , but it has much larger negative impacts to the family members and relatives .
Nowadays , social media sites are commonly used in the society .
In this particular case , we are discussing about whether a person should tell his relatives about him having a RISK of a particular genetic disease .

Since the technology of modern society has been so advanced , it becomes possible for people to make decision to take genetic test so as to be clear whether or not they carry genetic risk which can affect their next generation .
Then they are unable to have a suitable method to protect themselves and emotional preparations .
Personally , I strongly agree that social media brings more disadvantages compared to advantages it gives us .
And actually lots of rescuing jobs are done with the help of social media like looking for people get lost and so on .
In this case , I have to say that to err is human .
Therefore , this advantage of social media sites saves money and time , and also provides convenience for many people .
There is a story of a girl who lives in social media world every night in eight years .
It is immoral and impractical .
For a genetic risk carrier , there should be choice given with regards to informing his/her relatives .
For example , if social network does not exist , the business people need to meet each other face to face and it is other time consuming , even sometimes with business that is not so important , it still takes a lot time on travel which is a wastage .
One can not truly understand a person with only stalking his/her facebook page where he/she carefully chooses what to present .
However , as the government controls most of the media .
Information got circulated .
Albinism is one of the examples .
People who are not good at public chatting may be more reluctant to talk to people , and their interpersonal skills can never be improved under this situation .
However , we will never know whether this negative effects will happen when the carrier decide to tell his or her family of the his or her condition .
Let 's examine the advantages and disadvantages of using social media in our daily life and society .
This is not the case I am talking about here .

Whenever they need to use social media , they have to use a phone or internet .
People can think while typing and prepare what they want to say but in face-to-face communication , every word that comes out of your mouth and may be not well arranged is the picture of your personality .
In conclusion , social media sites cause both positive and negative consequences for people and society .
This type of communication does not help forging interpersonal relationships .
Some people spend a lot of time in it and forget their real life .
Families are our dearest in our life .
In conclusion , personally I feel that it is better for the carrier to inform her family members about the issue .
With the nature that the results will be known once the tests are done , each individual that is diagnosed to be a genetic risk carrier face an ethical problem : They should warn their relatives about the risking of being the same genetic risk carrier .
And also , we get a chance to talk to public people like popular stars and know their life better .
With just a touch away from any meida/electronic devices , one can easily interact and communicate with his friends without much hassle .

Together with the advancement of technology over past decades,medical advancement has increased exponentially and further enhancements are still constantly upgrading.Empower doctors with advance medical knowledge,doctors are able to diagnose and undergo genetic testing for patients to help them prevent and take necessary steps to protect their life.However , once a test has been conducted and the results are known,a question of disclosing the results to his or her relatives become a challenging issue to both patient and doctor.In my opinion,I feel the strong urge to support the obligation to inform patient relatives .
So all the married couples go run a test and know they are not carriers.They might subconsiously see him as different and worry that he will find a wife who will carry this gene as well .
The reason might just be that he or she just wants to " decorate " his or her face .
Hence , for a family in which every member is truly believing in each other and loving each other ,all these troubles are just testaments to make them stronger .
With the welcoming of application such as Skype and Facetime , any individual can phase off most , of the olden days communication methods .
For an example , if exercising is helpful for family potential disease , we can always look for more chances for the family to go exercise .
The largest negative impact is that due to the online network , some people start to use and rely on internet every minute .
Today , social media sites , such as Facebook and Twitter , are relatively common within the contemporary society ; and , people can communicate with each other , online or offline , on these social networking platforms .
One of them is that it reduce the level of concentration especially among the youngsters .
However , there are many problems againt the execution of asking a carrier to tell his or her ralatives the cause of his or her diseases .
However for some rare diseases , people who have certain gene changes are guaranteed to develop the disease .
For those who lives within the community should at least meet up , and not use social media as the primary source of communcation with each other .
People should avoid the misuse of socia media and use it in the proper way .
We can even know what a friend who leave thousands of miles away eat for lunch though these kinds of social media .
Finally , the technology of testing the gene is not very mature now .

One of the significant advantages of using a popular social media site is that people can reach other easily , even without contact for a long time .

In conclusion,the state should have passed a legal bill to measure and provide information to doctors that till which extend should a doctor opt to reveal to relatives members about the genetic disease and in which situations it is open to patient 's decision.In addition,the state could also encourage to create assistance schemes to aid necessary help to needy patients to encourage them to open up for the benefit of own and family members.Although it may face challenges from social ethic issues,in a long term,with appropriate encouragement and aid from the government,more individuals would have a different view of acceptance and take appropriate measurements to protect their own health and their loved ones .
Instead , all of them were more interested in posting pictures of this " cheerful " meeting on their social media sites .
Moreover , telling their family members the truth is the fastest and easiest way to get their support .
They may not able to enjoy a normal people can enjoy .
This can be easily seen in restaurants or cafes nowadays .
Therefore , social networks brings more and more connections between people and they may have a chance to chat with people they never known before , and this helps to develop the interpersonal skills as well .
A strong mental condition and conviction must be build from within and from the closest ones .
There are really a lot of things we need to consider .
In increasingly globalised world , such platforms even enhances and compliccates the links between indivduals in the world .
The sharing of information can be done faster through social media as well , that is why nowadays many news publishers make their own social media account , for example Channel News Asia has a twitter account and will update its follower with headline news .
Without trust and love , there is no difference between a family and a bunch of strangers living together .
In conclusion , a carrier of a known genetic risk should not be obligated to tell his or her relatives .
It saves a lot of money and time as well as strengthen our relationship although we stay at different places around the world .
Thus , advice from hospital plays the important role for this .
Such patients are still emotionally volatile or they may be unaware of the consequences of such genetic disorder due to their young age .

To sum up , social media has advantages and disadvantages in people 's daily life .
Aside from hearing the voice , a webcamera could also be affixed to emulate a 'real ' interaction with expressions and gestures .
Social media helps to lessen the hassle of geographical distance and brings people closer .

As we all know , genetic risk carriers are likely to pass the genetics to their family members .
Nowadays , with the advancement of technology , it is easy to do a genetic testing .
For example , a grandmother may have more authority to pass on information than an aunt , even when she is not at genetic risk herself while the aunt is .
They may feel uncomfortable when they communicate with people face to face .
And in my opinion , this seems to be the main purpose of undergoing that genetic testing at the first place .
It seems that people build a good relationship with others by the social media , but the problems come out .
There is a story I watched on TV .
I believe that most of us agree with these terms .
Nobody can deny social media 's advantages as the benefit it provides in connecting people regardless of nationalities , races , cultures and languages .
We ca n't make a law to push a carrier of a known genetic risk to tell his or her relatives about his genetic problem .
However , there is a role and a sense of responsibility to inform their relatives since it is a genetic disorder .
Though social media need not be necessarily bad , it must be used accordingly - for work , family , friends .
The users of every social media sites need to strike a balance between the real world versus the virtual one .
Furthermore this also possibly triggers the privacy issues as the Facebook allows some other profit-driven companies to have access to the information on the users .
But , if it is a terminal disease as a genetic disease , most of the relatives will be disheartened upon having the knowledge about it .
Everything comes with benefits will also have their disadvantages .
Many people feel that we should tell our relatives since we really care about their health status .
Therefore , there is need to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of social media .
Online friends became real life friends and real life friends communicate with one another online .
In those diseases , many who are affected do actually have different physical characteristics compared to those without the genetic diseases .
Nowadays , with the advancement of technology , it is easy to communicate wherever you are .
Some people will to post their expensive thing or the oversea places of interest they have been on the social network and get a feeling of satisfaction by doing so .
Again , there is a trend for them to suffer from social media addition and their study and work may be greatly influenced .
The auto correction software is so effective when using electronic device until we did not realize the importance of writing .
Some said that the genetic risk that is found in a person should be kept secret because it is considered as a personal information which should be kept confidential .
First of all , from the angle of human right , a genetic risk carrier should not be obligated to tell the truth to others .
Whether we are at home or at school , at work or on a holiday , we are able to communicate and interact with our friends .
social games ) which allow users to communicate with remote people , and also to update and express themselves at the same time .
Nowadays , social media are able to disseminate information faster than any other media .
Their son unfortunately fell ill and he was diagnosis a kind of genetic disease which is very serious .

In conclusion , the shadow always exists when there is light .
On the other side , as stated above , a person who want to confirm and has been prepared to face the result can choose to do the genetic testing individually .
Then , we need to talk about the advantages and disadvantages of using social media in your daily life and society .
It is againt his or her human rights and it is against the law 's spirit .
Frequently , the intention of the carriers does not want to tell their families are to continue their own life without the anxious of families .
This benefit can not be obtained through telephone or mail because people 's particular and address may change from time to time while on Facebook , people can keep in contact with old friends just by using name and photo , for example , as the identifier .
This has been indicated in a report done by Boston University in 2012 , 80 % of information posted online is true while a person may like 3 out of 10 times in real life .
However , every year the government has to spend a lot to help the disables such as medical subsidizes and builds up special schools to educate them .
If they spend too much time on these social media , it may cause some problems to their mental development .
The results are disclosed to husbands and wifes .
I personally think this ist he right purpose of going through the genetic testing , so that a family who can not afford to have a disabled kid do not have to give birth to their child and make the entire family suffer .
However , there is still a diversity of point of views among the people .
People indeed go to great length to make their words as shorter as they can .
Several arguments have been made regarding the social media actually have some inevitable disadvantages to people .
Genetic disorders are innate , but the great improvement of medical treatment makes it possible for humans to prevent the disorder or to reduce the negative effects of the disorder on themselves .
However , when people become more and more addicted to this convenience and fail to communicate with people who are close to them , their face-to-face interpersonal skills are lost .
In addition , privacy issue has become more popular nowadays since some people do not realize that they may actually share some information that they are not willing to share at the first place .
Therefore , it would be better for the carrier to be obligated to tell the information to the relatives , in order to let them know and prevent the potential disease through daily exercises .
Therefore , telling the relatives about the situation may avoid a lot of trouble in this way and save much time for proper treatment .
However , critics may argue that not all information or news disseminated are reliable .
Although emocons can be used to show certain emotion , this differs from the real authentic emotion of your friends when you observed them through their body language and their facial expression .
However , there are also some disadvantages occur due to the social media which are concerned in the society .
Hence , our social circle is indeed expanding .
People even prefer talk to their friends and meet their friends online and gradually reject face-to-face communication .
One of Manager in my working place has the same situation .
Firstly , I believe most of us will agree with the sentences below : " I will be anxious about my families when he or she told me that he or she was a carrier of a known genetic risk " .
If a law requires someone to tell others ' his or her privacy especially when the one is not willing to do so .
I think the family will stay mentally healty as it is , without having emtional stress .
This will result in unnecessary conflicts between two parties over miscommunication .
They may collect information about that person by asking his friends , colleagues or family members .
In a nutshell , a carrier of a known genetic risk should have their own right to decide whether to tell their relatives or not .
More importantly , it is cheap and easy to use social media .
This is a serious social problem and affects a lot of people .
It is normal for people to demand for a fair and similar treatment as the others and therefore it is normal for people to try to keep some of their secrets or personal issues to themselves in case some people judge them or treat them differently.Many people really love to hear what they want to hear and therefore they may just ignore the word 'risk ' and assume that the person has suffered from the disease .
Recent research has shown that the more people spend time on social media sites , the less they become ambitious .
If the person tell their relatives that he or she carries a disease gene , his or her relatives can go to hospital to check whether they also get a disease gene .
Last but not least , though genetic testing is a personal matter , telling the result to your family can improve and develop understanding and sympathy of each other as well as promoting awareness of taking care of everyone 's health .
When people around us know that we got certain disease , their altitudes will be easily changed , whether caring us too much or keeping away from us .
In conclusion , the showing up of social media sites is a double edged sword .
Nevertheless , while I fell that a carrier should not be obligated to tell his or her relatives about the genetic risk , I would like to suggest the person to at least share the information with her or his potential partner ( husband or wife ) since the individual 's genetic risk may affect their future children .
There are many people in the social media with beautiful image and good content in their pages , however in real life , he or she may do not have jobs or live poorly .
For example , if you find out one of your friend 's favourite singer is Justin Biber through facebook , you can give him or her Justin Biber 's new album or concert ticket as a birthday gift .
In less than a week half of the town knows person A has a risked gene , and his family might be a genetically risked family .
Distance and time are no longer the problems , which is convenient especially when instant chat is needed .
This also means that as soon a person is made aware of his or her genetic profile , he or she concurently has a knowledge about others .
Therefore I think a know genetic risk should not be obligated to tell his or her family or relatives .
Genetic testing has been made possible- it has become easy to tell if one is a carrier of a known genetic risk through genetic testing .
Do one who suffered from this disease keep it a secret of infrom their relatives ?
With the improvements of technology , a new life with genetic risk can be detected .
People can express themselves through pictures or emotions .
It is up to people 's discretion and comprehension to decide which side they want to take .
The burgeoning of social media definitely has its stint ; but amongst all good things , it is better to have them in moderation .
Facebook is like a combination of message and chatting service , personal profile , media of sharing , and other entertainment add-on ( i.e .
Personally I am study in oversea , busy study life keeps me away from contact my old friend .
On another hand , we could update our profile by posting on the wall and our friends could read up on the newsfeed .
The other advantage is that it is easier to know about others by social media .
They are just scrolling down pages of pages of pictures and statuses and see one of them which they might think it funny .
An example that may serve as an illustration is breast cancer .
People can use the information to deceive family and friends and banks to do bad things such as blackmail , ATM theft and so on .
Social media also provides people huge brunch information about people and things that they interests .
Hence , social media has benefited the masses by equipping them with a powerful tool to disseminate information almost immediate to the people around them .
And there are two basic reasons .
This kind of feeling makes people 's relationship not as stable , secure and reliable than before .
When people want to check whether they are genetic risk carriers , they can go and approach a doctor to consult about it .
There might be false information or hoaxes spreading around on social media .
Therefore , everytime when we use social media , we should take both sides into consideration and try to avoid be affected by the disadvantages .
Although there might be a lot of challenges along the way in seeking medical attention , such as financial issue , everyone should be given the rights of knowing their family 's inherented medical conditions .
After realizing the he or she is tshe carrier , the emotional damage would be hard to bear .
Without hanging out with friends or talking with friends through phone , we can know his of her latest news by scaning the webpage .
The debatable question , an ethical dilemma , is that are people responsible for telling their relatives that they carry a known genetic risk ?
However,there are still people against the decision of revealing private information.As in the case of Alzheimer patients,it is up to the patient 's own choice to disclose information.However,research has shown that doctors have tried to interpret who,how and whom will Alzheimer disease be disclosed to minimise potential negative impact to families members ( DementiaToday,2012 ) .There are associations provide helps to Alzheimer patients like Alzheimer 's Association ( Alzheimer 's Association,1980 ) .Although there are still thousand of genetic risk diseases out there that might not be receiving all helps and supports from everyone,the needs to receive immediate understanding and support from family members is an utmost help that patients need in their difficult time .
This is due to people spending comparatively more time on social networking than time on reading newpapers .
People that living in the modern world really can not live without the social media sites like Twitter and Facebook .
When things come to genetic issues , it is not that simple anymore .
If your genetic results show that you do not have changes associated with an increased risk of heart disease , it is still possible that you develop heart disease .
In my opinion , social media websides such as Twitter and Facebook will not affect the chance for people to have face to face contact and thus negatively affects interpersonal skills .
The idea seems great , and nowadays most people even the older generation will have at least one social media platform like Facebook .
Besides that , company also can use the convenience of social media sites , such as Facebook chat or Skype to facilitate the meeting with parties of project from around the world .
People and friends often mock of your conditions .
Genetic refers the chance of inheriting a disorder or disease .
Those who are born into a family with a history of genetic disease should be allowed to undergo genetic testing , even though if there is no risk at all .
Other than that , sometimes the message of one party can not be delivered properly to the other one since the communication is done through written language , and thus the 'tone ' of the message sent and when it is received may be different .
For example , if an unmarried person has gene Aa and gene aa is sufficient for a very seriou disease .
The earlier we tell them , a better habit they will arise and better for the rest of their lives .
To put it in the nutshell , everything has its own pros and cons .
Social media sites like Facebook and Twitter are born with the intention of connecting people , from around the world .
Finding old friends through Facebook , for example , is more easier than asking people around in real life .
Genetic risk refers more to your chance of inheriting a disorder or disease .
This essay will discuss about the advantages and disadvantages of using social media in our daily life .

Furthermore , with the current technology , smartphones are able to get access to social media sites which have made easier for consumers to use .
Particularly , in the medical field , there is a great improvement in many treatments for many formally incurable diseases , and genetic testing is one of the methods which were used to diagnose an individual at risk for a genetic disorder .
Since we can see both advantages and disadvantages of using social media , and we can not deny the huge benefits that have been brought to us , this main trend of using social media may be still lasting for a long time .
Tears showed nothing .
If the relatives carry that disease gene , they can share the experience with him or her and give some help , they will also teach him or her how to communicate with others about this issue .
However , it is good for sharing information .
Thus , the lack of face-to-face human contact through social media restricts actual interaction which can be stimulated through the media .
Regardlessly , if the disorder is rarely to be fatal , or it does not caused any inconvenience to the carrier , revealing the truth is always the right thing to do .
More people ( relatives ) know her problem , more information channel is provided .
Social media is a trending channel and a suitable mean of communications .
In conclusion , we could tell the benefits of telling genetic risk to the carriers relatives overweights the costs .
This is because it is part of everyone 's habit to check their facebook 's page as their friends will post something new every second .
In the past decades , when the social media sites are not yet fully developed , people connect with others who live far away by using a phone , or even a letter .
It also helps people to develop their interpersonal skills through online chating .
Most patients will be depressed after realising his or her conditions .

It is just different .
Furthermore , you are also being responsible for your next generations by telling the truth that you are a carrier of a genetic risk .
There are possible negative consequences that those might face if they disclose their genetic results to their relative .

It is unfair to release a law only point to the genetic disorder .
With more convinient and humanian communications , the relationship between government and people get largely improved .
In this essay , few arguments will be pointed out in the support of view for any carrier of that known genetic risk to tell his or her relatives .

In the past , it took a few days to receive a message as we need to post our letter and now , we can use e-mail which stands for electronic message to send messages to our friends or even use our handphone to send our messages .
Nowadays , it is quite common to see on some party , people would more prefer looking at their phones and reading all the posts on facebook if they feel bored .
The inclusion of intimate presence and relative touch could also bring a better rapport between those interacting .
Family members , as one the closest group of people from whom they can get comfort , is a crucial factor for them to successfully get over any possible troubles as a result of genetic disorder .

However , I believe it is just a usual reaction to this situation .
It is almost imposible for us to keep way from it .
In the past , vast communication are done by one of the many such a telegram , snail mail and poor-quality voice calls .
I believe that some of the carriers will choose to not reveal their disease to the family members as they do not want to make their family members worry and feel uncomfortable or even feel ostracized by them .

For example , on Twitter , it is exciting to follow people that you adore like famous movie and series stars , business men and entrepreneurs .

Ultimately , the best way to enhance interpersonal skills is still through face-to-face meetings but social media sites are only the tools to enhance it .
From the legal aspect , the answer is no but from the ethical aspect , the answer should be yes .
We should keep in mind that there are still ways for us to contact with our family or friends .

People around the world could easily share their thoughts about their governments .
Thirdly , a lot of updating of luxury living standard as well as other show-off situations may make people 's daily life more and more grandiloquent , which is not an accurate social growing trend .

In cases where an individual has gotten to know of a genetic disorder , disclosing or otherwise , to his or her relative is solely a matter of preference within the indivdial moral system .
Teenagers are developing their interpersonal skills and social skills when they are growing up .
There might be a possibility that the genetic disorder could also affect their relatives and any other families within the same family tree .
As far as I am concerned , when a couple are going to have babies , they are going to run a few tests and see whether their could have some genetic diseases .
Though it is said that genetic testing involves emotional and social risks due to the test results , while the potential negative impacts of the risk still exist , the consequence will be significant if other members of his or her family do not know .

The courage to take the genetic testing and yet to inform their relatives about the risk that they may have may result in people being judgmental while actually it is just a risk and not a confirmed case .

Relatives will certainly be supportive and show more caring towards the carrier of a known genetic risk .
Despite the luxury that is offered by social media , there are also harmful side effects which people may not realize it beforehand .
Another disadvantage that affects other people is that by only showing selected part of our lives , we build " false image " in public .
I belive that even the carrier has the right not to know the true fact .
More and more networking has been transferred to internet from real life .
As a result , it could affect their lives and studies .
However , once a test has been conducted and the results are known , a family-related ethical dilemma is born .
The advantages and disadvantages of using such social media in the society are elaborated on as follows .
It is true that social media makes people be able to connect one another more conveniently .
Young people can widen their relationships , meet new friends and learn wonderful things in many parts of the world .
Social media has been playing a vital important role in our lives today .
Consider a case , we decide to undergo genetic testing and have known the result of it .
By doing so , one will feel less stressful in facing such disorder risk .
Nowadays , people can just easily put their renting information on their facebook account and wait for the response from others who are from different parts of the world which brings us a huge amount of convenience .
This knowledge maybe relavant to them , and vice versa .
That is because we are acting who we are in reality while we have no reason to do that in the online virtual world .
Nevertheless , it will depend on what kind of genetic diseases , given in the context of current medical technology .
This subsequently leads to the poor interpersonal skills that inhibit the growth of our real social circle .
Social media does have some other advantages beside their general benefits to human being .
Once his or her family or relatives know that the person does not have the relation with them .
Furthermore , the annouance of genetic risk would affect the relationship with the relatives as sometimes others may think not to stay too close to the carrier so that they have less chance to get the potential disease .
Thus , whether there are more advantages or disadvantages becomes a tough question for every human being .
Every family member has their human right to know what is going on with them .
What 's more they may undergo genetic test as well to see whether they are carrying it or not which is also better for them .
Many people like to use language to pretend themselves , and lost confidence when they talk to each other .
In this case , the social network helps people to increase the frequency of talk .
In the past , we travel by ship and now we can use airplane to do so .
However , after one has registered in those social media sites which are not reliable , all the information you have filled in will be a weapon against you in the future .
But , there will still be unreliable sources spreading false information on social media sites despite high security to control almost every social networking movement .
And if the results turn out to be otherwise , then the family can be prepared emotionally and psychologically of the future outcome and aid them in making upcoming decisions .
Having support from relatives are vital as they ensure the genetic risk carrier that he/she is not alone in facing this illness and it will certainly provide a morale boost as the whole family will share a common sentiment with regards towards the future prospect of the genetic disorder which could be inherited by anyone in the family .
It is weird that people sit around the table but all face to their phones and do not talk with each other .
It is a concern that will be with us during our whole life , because we will never know when the ''potential bomb' ' will explode .
He has to choose whether to protect his family or make his family more prosperity with a potential generic risk .
Other people then are influenced by us and tend to do the same .
We may meet only once but we exchange our contact numbers as well as facebook account in order to keep in touch .
People can contact their friends on the internet and get their reply very fast .
However , critics may argue that with the existence of social media sites have reduced physical human interactions among people as they will prefer sitting in front of a computer to going out and meeting new friends .
For example , on mother 's day , people are shy to say " I love you " to their mothers so they can type it on his or her mother 's facebook page .
By doing this ,they may be able to save some lives of their relatives .
We broadcast these facades of us to others .
One can choose to tell their relatives if they are at risk .
Socia media allows them to explain to or inform people what is going on .
In conclude , people should think carefully of what is the consequences of telling the relatives his or her generic disorder issue .
People usually get this kind of hypertesion after they become adult .
It could possibly causes a problem in a family due to the fact and creates more unhappiness int the family .
Since ancient times , human interact with others face by face .
They can build a daily habit to eat less salt and fat and thus to avoid hypertension .
Although it is really useful when we need to use it to let other people know we really live a good life , it wastes us a lot of time as well .
Every choice we have made may have a huge impact on their whole life .
They always have a choice about whether to undergo the genetic test or not .
Nevertheless , with those advantages , some disadvantages may appear such as reduction in face-to-face human contact which affects interpersonal skills , privacy issue , as well as some frauds that can be done through social media .
The danger of such media socialisation is the uncertainty of such communication due to lack of physical interaction .
It can help us know more about each other .
Sometimes a family with potential genetic disorder risk may not be able to detect the potential harm inside their bodies as none of their members reflect any observable disorder symptoms .
However , the social media sites truly reduce the communication in face-to-face which truly affects interpersonal skills .
We used to send wishes cards during festive season like Chinese New Year , and we feel so good to write one and of course to receive one with stamps on it .
However , they can avoid the disease genes being inhered to their children .
However , social media site is a double-sided sword , it also bring in some negative effect on our daily life .
Even though you can not eliminate the risk completely , you can at least try to be alert to avoiding getting the disease .
Intimate interaction greatly lack in social media interactions , particularly the touch .
The relationship between the parents and their children should not be tested only in the genetic way ; it is something much deeper and tighter .
They need to ask for doctor 's advice before they plan to have a baby .
How do social media help change our lives ?
The disadvantages of social network media are quite undeniable .
In addition , a woman testing positive for BRCA1 would be expected to allow her brother or sister to disclose such information to a niece or nephew rather than do it herself , although this may be further complicated by an individual 's response to risk information as they not want to know .
Then his or her mother will also know the emotion and feel warm .
For example , in 2012 general election is Singapore , Dr Tan Chee Keong made use of facebook to spread his campaign videos to the public .
Through those sites we are able to talk to them , to know what their activities are and who their friends are , etc. From the surface point of view it is no doubt that these sites help us to have a better relationship with our relatives despite of the distance .
After he takes the test and be obliged to tell his relatives , everyone know that he is a carrier .
In conclusion , the use of social media has more advantages than disadvantages to our daily lifes .
So , we should never forget to think of and calculate the benefit and loss of every decision that we make .
Whose duty it is to inform at risk relatives or not greatly depends on the personal moral and the nature of how 'directive ' the risk is to them .
Generally people need they eyes to look at the display screen of their phone or computer and fingers to manipulate the corresponding device .
Not only one but many developed and developing countries have the same picture .
Thus , socialisation can occur seamlessly and effectively with the utilisation of such social media platforms.Meet-ups and appointments are no longer a barrier for humans to contact and communicate with one another , making human interaction possible at one 's own convenience .
